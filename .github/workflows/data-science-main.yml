# This workflow uses a 3-job structure to optimize CI performance:
#
# 1. build-devcontainer-image: Builds ONLY the devcontainer image (base environment, no deps) and pushes to registry, for use by subsequent jobs, and to speed upDevpod.
# 2. quality-checks & tests: Pulls the prebuilt devcontainer image, run in PARALLEL, installing fresh deps each time, to avoid stale dependencies.

jobs:
  build-devcontainer-image:
    # Builds and publishes the devcontainer image using DevPod CLI (required for devpod up compatibility).
    # DevPod build creates images with hash-based tags, which we also tag as 'latest' for use by CI jobs.
