# Introduction

# Executive Summary

# Foundation: Relative Fuel Prices and System Efficiency
- Here we include Lee's inequality

## Left Side: Fuel Rates
- Electricity is ~3x cheaper per kWh than natural gas

### Electricity prices in New England
- Cite: Wiser et al, 2025

## Right Side: Heating System Efficiency
- heat pumps are ~3x more efficient than fossil furnaces and electric resistance heaters

# Device Efficiency
## Using Bill Calculations from RI_HP_Rates
- We have full bill calculations for each home in Rhode Island, before and after switching to heat pumps
- How does the old furnance's efficiency impact the bill _change_?
  - Show plot of bill change vs AFUE

### Isolating Furnace Efficiency
- Most folks have a furnance with nominal AFUE of 80%
- Do we still see large variance among these homes?

## Isolating Heating Bills
- Just looking at the _volumetric_ **heating** bills
  - heating: only considering the heating load
  - volumetric: just multiplying the consumption by the combined supply and delivery rates


## Estimating COP
- HP efficiency is not constant, but rather depends on relative temp


# Impacts on Bills: Rhode Island Example
## Load Profiles
- Running at night is generally less efficient
- Poorly insulated homes (that is, with less thermal inertia) have work harder when the temp is low
- So the house insulation and heating *pattern* is also a factor in the monthly consumption, and thus the bill

## Floor area as a proxy for heating loss


# Zooming Out: Dynamic Tariffs and Grid Impacts

## Grid Impacts
- hourly consumption pattern is also important for grid impacts
- Expect the winter peak will be at the
- Most homes now have a winter peak/summer peak ratio of xx%

## Dynamic Tariffs
- Example: Cosy Octopus
  - which roughly tracks _supply_ prices


## Tariffs for Distribution Grid Impacts
- How does heat pump adoption impact the distribution grid?
- A TOU tariff should incentivize consumption away from the individual feeders' peaks...but how do we know that peak time?



# Appendix
## Due Diligence
- Does the total heat delivered stay the same for a given bldg_id across upgrades?
  - because one core assumption is that $\int_{t_0}^{t_{\text{end}}} HL(t)$ is constant
  - "the home's temperature controller meets its objective"
