## Notes for modeling

- MEAP is a **heating** grant paid to the fuel supplier / utility on the customer’s behalf (see DHS OHEP “About energy assistance”).
- Lookup keys: **(Poverty Level, heating fuel)**. No usage band — unlike EUSP.
- Level 6 in this matrix is labeled **Subsidized/Sub-metered**, not an FPL band. Level 7 is **Over 200% FPL**.
