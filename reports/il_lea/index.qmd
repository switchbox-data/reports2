# Executive Summary




# Background

## What are Line Extension Allowances?

When gas utilities connect new customers, they often need to extend the natural gas distribution system to reach them. This requires investment in both main and service line extensions. [^main_service] Rather then the new customer paying for the cost of the connection, the bulk of the cost is borne by existing gas customers through Line Extension Allowances (LEAs). LEAs are ratepayer funded subsidies that reduce the household cost of expanding the distribution system to reach new customers. In Illinois, the amount of the LEA subsidy is determined by a maximum footage allowed per customer - 100 or 200 feet for mains (low or high pressure) and 60 feet for service lines. While Illinois Administrative Code requires gas utilities to provide LEA subsidies for urban customers, most utiliites voluntarily extend the same allowances to rural customers. Spending on LEAs ultimately increases the revenue requirement for gas utilities, driving up bills for ratepayers for years after the inital investments are made.

[^main_service]: "**Main**" refers to the main gas distribution line that connects to the customer's property. "**Service**" refers to the smaller line that connects to the main line and serves the customer's home.

## Why are states revisiting LEA policies?
Historically, LEAs were established to grow the gas system, allowing utilities to capitalize on economies of scale in the distribution system. There was an embeded assumption that customers would stay in the system for the long term and costs associated with LEAs would be recouped through increased revenue from the growing customer base. Today, rising gas bills and broader awarness of the enviromental damage associated with natural gas emissions are leading regulators to reevaluate the role of LEAs in the natural gas system.

As states progress towards their climate goals, they are increasingly looking to electrify buildings and transportation systems. Continued expansion of the natural gas system not only runs counter to emissions reduction targets, but also encourages additional capital investment in infrastructure that may no longer be needed in a future with reduced gas demand. [^stranded_assets]

[^stranded_assets]: "**Stranded assets**" refers to gas infrastructure—such as pipelines or distribution networks—that is rendered obsolete or uneconomic before the end of its expected useful life because customers shift away from natural gas, potentially leaving a shrinking utility ratepayers responsible for paying off investments in infrastructure they no longer use.

With the growing availablity of cost-effective electric alternatives to gas heating, the historical motivations for supporting the expansion of gas infrastructure are increasingly being questioned. Eight states have passed or are currently considering legislation to limit or phase out LEA spending at the time of this report. @henchen_CuttingTheseSubsidies_2025 The Illinois Commerce Commission has expressed interest in reviewing LEA policies as part of it's on going work on the Future of Gas. Bill SB2269, introduced in the Illinois General Assembly earlier this year would require gas utilities to charge customers for the full incremental cost of new development and growth their connection creates. [^sb2269] @villanueva_SB2269_2025

[^sb2269]: [§ 9-228.5](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26212423-il-sb2269-villanueva/#document/p29/a2676215): "Gas main and gas service extension policies shall be based on the principle that the full incremental cost associated with new development and growth shall be borne by the customers that cause those incremental costs. Gas main and gas service extension policies, procedures, and conditions shall align with the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals established in Article XXIV." @villanueva_SB2269_2025

# LEA Spending in Illinois
There is limited data on what gas utilities in Illinois are spending on LEA projects. We present a mix of data including historical and forecasted spending data collected from ratecases and best estimates for missing data. [^data_sources]

[^data_sources]: For more details on the data presented please see table TK in TK APPENDIX.


## Nicor
From `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "nicor_main_historical")` to `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "nicor_main_historical")`, Nicor averaged `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "nicor_main_historical")` per year on main LEA subsidies and `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "nicor_service_historical")` per year on service line subsidies.
Nicor is forcasted to spend `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")` per year on LEA subsidies between `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")` and `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")`, totaling `r fetch_spending_vars("total", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")` over the next 5 years.

:::

Nicor reported spending an average of `r nicor_per_connect_23` per new connection on LEA subsidies for main extension allowances in 2023. This figure does not include service line extensions. Over the years reported, cost per connection has consistently increased year-on-year with an average annual increase of `r nicor_per_connect_change`.

## Peoples Gas

From `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "peoples_main_historical")` to `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "peoples_main_historical")`, Peoples Gas averaged `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_main_historical")` per year on main LEA subsidies and `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_service_historical")` per year on service line subsidies. Average annual forecasted spending for `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "peoples_main_forecast")` to `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "peoples_main_forecast")` was `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_main_forecast")` per year on main extensioins and `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_service_forecast")` per year on service line extensions.

People's Gas most recently reported average cost per new connection was `r peoples_per_connect_22` (2022). This figure is combined for both main and service line extensions.

## Ameren

Ameren has denied requests to report directly on LEA spending. As an approximation, we have included material spending associated with new gas connections and the standard cost equivalent per connection for Ameren Gas.[^std_cost_equiv]

[^std_cost_equiv]: The standard cost equivalent per connection is the maximum LEA subsidy per new connection for Ameren Gas. The remainder of the connection cost is the responsibility of the customer.

as of this report - main line extension double other gas utilities (current rate case proposes reduction from 400 to 200 miles)
report TK on expansion of distribution system (TK)
