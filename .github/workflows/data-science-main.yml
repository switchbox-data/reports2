# ============================================================================
# CI/CD ARCHITECTURE: Devcontainer Build + Parallel Test Execution
# ============================================================================
#
# This workflow uses a 3-job structure to optimize CI performance:
#
# 1. build-devcontainer-image: Builds the devcontainer image and pushes to GHCR
# 2. quality-checks & tests: Pull the prebuilt image and run checks in PARALLEL
#
# WHY USE DEVPOD FOR CI BUILDS?
#
# We use DevPod CLI (not docker/build-push-action) to build devcontainer images
# because it creates a hash-based tag for the image, which is required if we want
# to use the prebuilt image with devpod up.
#
#   Layer 1: Hash-Based Caching (Complete Skip)
#     - DevPod hashes devcontainer.json + Dockerfile + build context files
#     - If hash matches existing image → Skip build entirely (~30s vs ~8min)
#     - Example: Changing only README.md doesn't rebuild the image
#
#   Layer 2: BuildKit Registry Layer Caching (Incremental Build)
#     - When hash changes → DevPod performs an incremental rebuild
#     - BuildKit reuses unchanged layers from GHCR registry cache
#     - Only rebuilds layers starting from the changed file
#     - Example: Adding a Python package only rebuilds the final Python deps layer
#
# CACHE STORAGE:
#
#   - Final images: ghcr.io/switchbox-data/reports2:devpod-<hash> (hash-based tag)
#                   ghcr.io/switchbox-data/reports2:latest (for CI jobs)
#   - Layer cache:  ghcr.io/switchbox-data/reports2:buildcache (stable tag)
#
# WHY A DEDICATED :buildcache TAG?
#
# BuildKit needs a stable reference to store/retrieve layer cache. Using the
# image tags (devpod-<hash>, latest) doesn't work because they change on every
# build. The :buildcache tag persists across builds, allowing BuildKit to
# accumulate cached layers over time.
#
# EXPECTED BUILD TIMES:
#
#   - Cache hit (hash match):      ~30s (no rebuild)
#   - Layer cache hit:             ~2-4min (incremental rebuild)
#   - Full rebuild (no cache):     ~8min (everything from scratch)
#

          # DevPod automatically translates REGISTRY_CACHE into BuildKit cache flags:

          #   --cache-to type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/switchbox-data/reports2:buildcache,mode=max
          #
          # mode=max ensures ALL intermediate layers are cached (not just the final image).
          # This allows BuildKit to reuse layers even when the final image hash changes.
          #
          # Example: If you add a Python package (changing pyproject.toml):
          #   - Layers 1-21 (base Ubuntu, R, Quarto, etc.): CACHED ✓ (pulled from :buildcache)
          #   - Layer 22 (Python deps): REBUILT (only this layer changes)
          #
          # This turns an 8-minute full rebuild into a ~2-minute incremental rebuild.

          # DEVPOD TAGGING BEHAVIOR:
          #
          # DevPod automatically creates two tags for the built image:
          #   1. devpod-<hash> - Hash-based tag for `devpod up` compatibility
          #   2. latest - Via --tag flag, used by downstream CI jobs
          #
          # The hash is calculated from:
          #   - devcontainer.json content
          #   - Dockerfile content
          #   - Files COPYed in Dockerfile (install scripts, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, etc.)
          #
          # If the hash matches an existing image in the registry → DevPod skips the
          # build entirely and just pulls the existing image (~30s instead of minutes).
          #
          # If the hash is different → DevPod performs a full build, but BuildKit
          # still uses layer caching (configured above) to reuse unchanged layers.

    #
    # Note: why container keyword instead of devcontainers/ci?
    # devcontainers/ci always rebuilds the image (~2-8 minutes), even with cacheFrom.
