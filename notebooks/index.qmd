# Welcome to Quarto!

This is your introduction to **Quarto** - a powerful publishing system for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and visualizations.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into finished documents. Think of it as:

- **Jupyter notebooks** + **Markdown** + **Publishing power**
- Write in `.qmd` files (Quarto Markdown)
- Execute Python, R, Julia, or Observable code
- Render to HTML, PDF, Word, presentations, and more

## This Notebooks Directory

This `notebooks/` directory contains your Quarto project with these files:

```
notebooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ _quarto.yml          # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ index.qmd           # This homepage (you're here!)
â”œâ”€â”€ md_example.qmd      # Pure markdown example
â”œâ”€â”€ py_example.qmd      # Python data analysis example
â”œâ”€â”€ r_example.qmd       # R data analysis example
â”œâ”€â”€ Justfile            # Automation commands
â””â”€â”€ _site/              # Generated website (after rendering)
```

## Getting Started with the Justfile

The `Justfile` in this directory provides convenient commands for working with Quarto. Here are the essential ones:

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start live preview server (auto-reloads on changes)
just preview

# Render all documents to HTML
just render

# Clean up generated files
just clean
```

### Creating Content
```bash
# Create a new Quarto document
just new my-analysis

# Convert existing Jupyter notebook
just convert my-notebook.ipynb
```

### Publishing
```bash
# Publish to GitHub Pages (if configured)
just publish

# See all available commands
just --list
```

## Try It Out!

1. **Start the preview server**: Run `just preview` in your terminal
2. **Edit this file**: Make changes to `index.qmd` and watch them appear instantly
3. **Explore examples**: Check out the other `.qmd` files in this directory
4. **Create something new**: Create your own `.qmd` files in this directory

## Document Structure

Quarto documents start with **YAML frontmatter** (the section between `---`):

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author: "Your Name"
date: today
format: html
---
```

Then you write in **Markdown** with optional **code blocks**:

````{markdown eval="false"}
# My Analysis

Some text here.

```{python}
print("Hello from Python!")
```
```{r}
print("Hello from R!")
```


More text here.
````

## Next Steps

- **Explore the examples** in this directory
- **Read the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)**
- **Try different output formats** (PDF, presentations, etc.)
- **Add your own analysis and visualizations**

Happy documenting! ðŸš€
