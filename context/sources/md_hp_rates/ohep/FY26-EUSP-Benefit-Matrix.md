Amounts below are **annual grant dollars** by OHEP Poverty / Benefit Level, primary heat source, and annual electric usage band. Extracted from the source `.docx` via `pandoc -t plain`. Source table headers sometimes show typographical artifacts (e.g. `12,0000kw`); usage bands are interpreted as:

| Band label in source                 | Interpreted annual kWh |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `0-4,000kw`                          | 0–4,000 kWh            |
| `4,001-8,000kw`                      | 4,001–8,000 kWh        |
| `8,001-12,0000kw` / `8,001-12,000kw` | 8,001–12,000 kWh       |
| `> 12,000kw`                         | > 12,000 kWh           |

## Notes for modeling

- EUSP is OHEP’s **electric** assistance grant (once per program year). Recipients may choose budget billing (DHS OHEP “About energy assistance”).
- Lookup keys: **(Poverty Level, primary heat source, annual electric kWh band)**.
- Level 6 is a **housing / metering category** (subsidized / roomer / boarder / sub-metered), not an FPL band. Level 7 is **>200% FPL, categorically eligible only**.
