# Exhibit CLP-RATES-2 — Rate Design and Revenue Workpapers (Residential classes only: Rate 1, 5, 7; MRCC)

**Source**: `Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.xlsx` (179-tab workbook; `Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.pdf` is the same workbook "printed to PDF" and was not used as a source here)
**Docket**: Connecticut PURA Docket No. 26-05-10 — Application of The Connecticut Light and Power Company d/b/a Eversource Energy to Amend Its Rate Schedules
**Exhibit**: CLP-RATES-2 (Rate Design and Revenue), sub-exhibits CLP-RATES-2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.13

**Extraction method**: Read directly via `openpyxl` (`data_only=True`, i.e. cached calculated values, not formulas) from `Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.xlsx` (the accompanying `Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.pdf` is the same workbook printed to PDF). This is a **scoped extract**: the full workbook covers all rate classes (Rate 1 through Rate 119, EV classes, street lighting) across 14 sub-exhibits (`CLP-RATES-2.1` through `2.14`); only the tabs and rows relevant to the **residential classes** (Rate 1 — Residential Electric Service, Rate 5 — Residential Electric Heating, Rate 7 — Residential Time-of-Day) and the Maximum Residential Customer Charge (MRCC, `Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.13`) were transcribed, plus the residential rows of `Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.10` (Schedule E-2.1). Rate 6 (new Optional Residential Space Heating rate) has no workpaper in `CLP-RATES-2.4` because it is a new rate with no current-rate billing history; its tariff structure is captured separately in `exhibit_clp_rates_3_residential_tariffs.md`. Dollar figures below are in `$(000)'s` unless noted; per-unit rates are `$` (customer charge) or `$/kWh`.

## 1. Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.1 — Comparison of Distribution Revenue at Current vs. Proposed Rates

Tab `Exh 2.1, 1 of 2`. Rate Year ending 6/30/2028. Columns: `A` = Rate Year Billed Sales (MWh), `B` = Current Rate Distribution (Rev `$000`), `C` = GET Refund (Rev `$000`), `D = B - C` = Adjusted Distribution, `E = D x Test Year Avg GET Rate` = GET Revenue, `F = D + E`... [formula labels per the sheet's own header row; see column headers below]. Residential rows only:

## 2. Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.4 — Billing Determinants / Test Year and Rate Year Workpapers

Each rate has 3 tabs: (1) Billing Determinants Workpaper, (2) Test Year Ending 2025 Workpapers, (3) Rate Year Workpapers. All figures below are the **Rate Year** (ending 6/30/2028) columns from workpaper (3) unless noted; workpaper (2)'s Test Year figures are given separately where they differ materially (GET rate and a few normalization adjustments).

### 2a. Rate 1 — Residential Electric Service (tabs `Exh 2.4, R1 1–3 of 75`)

**Billing determinants** (tab 1, `Page 1 of 75`):

Normalized TY Average # Bills = Actual (no weather adjustment on bills). Normalized TY Total Sales = Billed Sales + Primary Metering Credit. `Exh 2.10` uses **Total Sales**; volumetric Distribution revenue in this workpaper is computed on **Billed Sales** (`0.05844 × 8,440,783.01 = 493,279.36` in `$000`).

**Test Year Ending 2025 current vs. proposed rate build** (tab 2, `Page 2 of 75`) — Normalized columns:

Total `% Change` = `18.075%` (matches the customer-charge-block total above to within rounding; the workpaper computes it twice, once per price-block build and once per functional-category rollup, and the two differ in the 3rd decimal — `18.075%` vs `18.079%` in the Test Year tab — due to normalization-adjustment timing between Actual and Normalized sales).

## 3. Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.13 — Calculation of Maximum Residential Customer Charge (MRCC)

Tab `Exh 2.13, 1 of 19` ("Summary of MRCC by Item"), which per the exhibit's own cover/TOC is the top-level summary rolling up Rate Base (Services, Meters, Office Furniture & Equipment, Transportation Equipment, Stores Equipment, Tools/Shop/Garage Equipment, Laboratory Equipment, Power Operated Equipment, Communication Equipment, Miscellaneous Equipment, Rate Base Adds/Deducts) → Expenses (Distribution Supervision & Engineering, Meter Expenses, Overhead Lines Expense-Services, Customer Accounting Supervision, Meter Reading, Customer Records and Collection, Miscellaneous Customer Accounts, Customer Assistance, Miscellaneous Customer Service, Salaries, Office Supplies, Admin Expenses & Transfer Credit, Outside Services, Property Insurance, Injuries & Damages, Pension & Benefit, Misc. General, Depreciation & Amortization, Property Taxes, Payroll Taxes) → Taxes (Current Income Taxes, Gross Receipts Tax, Deferred Income Taxes):

| Item                      | Rate Base / Expense (`$`) | MRCC (`$`/month) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Total Return on Rate Base | 26,258.11                 | 2.0674           |
| Total Expenses            | 103,256.57                | 8.1298           |
| Total Taxes               | 11,342.39                 | 0.8930           |
| **Total**                 | **140,857.07**            | **11.0902**      |

Footnotes on this tab: (a) Number of Customers used for this calculation = `1,058,422.5` (source: `Exhibit CLP-ACOS-2, Appendix 1.b Customers - (Rates 1 & 7)`); (b) Return = `7.74%` ("Proposed total capitalization"). Column formula per the sheet header: `MRCC ($/Month) = (Rate Base/Expense) / (a) / 12 months × 1000`.

**Discrepancy to flag**: this tab's computed **Total MRCC is `$11.09`/month**, whereas `Exhibit CLP-RATES-1` (testimony) states "the Company completed the MRCC calculation, as provided in Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.13. This calculation produced a customer charge of `$12.36` for Rate 1 and Rate 7," and the `Exh 2.4, R1`/`R7` rate-design tabs use a pre-GET proposed customer charge of `$11.52` (which grosses up to `$12.36` with the `6.8%` distribution GET, i.e. `11.52 / (1 - 0.068) ≈ 12.36`). The `$11.09` MRCC-tab total and the `$11.52` pre-GET figure actually used in rate design do not reconcile in the pages transcribed here (Test Year cost/customer-count basis vs. whatever basis produced `$11.52` is unclear from this tab alone). This has **not** been resolved — it would need the remaining `Exh 2.13, 2–19 of 19` backup pages (Rate Base detail, Expense detail by FERC account, footnote (b) capitalization detail) to trace, which were not extracted in this scoped pass.

## 4. Exhibit CLP-RATES-2.10 — Test Year and Rate Year Revenues at Current Rates (Schedule E-2.1)

Cover tab: `Cover Exh 2.10`. Body tabs: `Exh 2.10, 1 of 2` (Test Year Ending 2025) and `Exh 2.10, 2 of 2` (Rate Year Ending 6/30/2028). Columns: Average Number of Customer Bills Rendered; Weather Normalized / RY Forecasted Sales (MWh); Average Current Rates (¢/kWh); Base Revenue (`$000`); Fuel Adjustment Revenue (`$000`); Total Revenue (`$000`). Data reference for each rate points back to the matching `Exh 2.4` pages.

**Important for Track 2:** Total Revenue here is **all-in** (distribution + transmission + public benefits + supply) at current rates — **not** the base delivery RR. Use `Exh 2.4` Test Year Distribution functional revenue for `delivery_revenue_requirement_from_rate_case`. The Bills / Sales columns below are the right sources for `test_year_customer_count` and `test_year_residential_kwh`.

"Average Number of Customer Bills Rendered" is an **average monthly** bill count (matches `Exh 2.4` "Average # Bills Rendered"), not annual bills. Annual bills = this figure × 12 (see Billing Months on `Exh 2.4` tab 1).

Sales on this schedule are **Total Sales** (Billed + Primary Metering Credit). Rate 1 billed-only sales = `8,440,783.01` MWh (`Exh 2.4`); the `12.30` MWh primary-metering difference is immaterial for most scaling uses (~0.00015%).
