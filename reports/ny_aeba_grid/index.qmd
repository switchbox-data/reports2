# Introduction

In May 2023, New York became the first state to pass a law requiring all new buildings to be all-electric: the **All-Electric Building Act** (AEBA).

On January 1, 2026, the first part of the AEBA will take effect: residential buildings seven stories or fewer will be required to be all-electric, as will commercial and industrial buildings 100,000 square feet or less.[^residentialcommercial]

[^residentialcommercial]: The AEBA will apply to all new buildings, with a few exemptions, starting on January 1, 2029; see [§11-104-6(b)](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/ENG/11-104) of the New York State Energy Conservation Construction Code.

As the state looks ahead to the launch of the nation's first all-electric new construction standard, Switchbox is releasing this analysis of the AEBA's impact on New York's electric grid.

In the wake of two grid reliability reports from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO),[^nyiso_reliability_reports] moderate Democrats in the New York State Assembly are pushing Gov. Hochul to delay implementing the AEBA she signed into law in 2023.[^news]

[^nyiso_reliability_reports]: The Q3 STAR report [@nyiso_ShortTermAssessmentReliability_2025], which identifies reliability risks over the next five years, and the Comprehensive Reliability Plan 2025-2034 [@nyiso_ComprehensiveReliabilityPlan_2025], which looks at the next decade.

[^news]: As first reported by [Spectrum News](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2025/10/21/moderate-assembly-dems-push-hochul-to-delay-all-electric-buildings-mandate) [@lisa_ModerateAssemblyDems_2025].

Claiming that "NYISO has flagged serious [grid reliability] concerns that warrant a more cautious approach," moderate Democrats in the New York State Assembly have sent a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul, asking her to "suspend enforcement of the new building electrification requirement" until the state "evaluates grid readiness under high electrification".[^letter]

[^letter]: The [sign-on letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26205362-letter-to-gov-kathy-hochul-requesting-pause-of-all-electric-building-act-implementation-2025/) [@conrad_LetterGovKathy_2025] was authored by Assemblymember William Conrad (D-AD 140).

Despite asserting that NYISO's recent reliability reports warrant delaying the AEBA's implementation, the letter includes no analysis of how the law—which only applies to _new_ buildings—would actually affect the grid.

To shed some light on the grid impacts of the AEBA, this report seeks to answer the following questions:

- Will the AEBA actually spur "high electrification", given the state's expected pace of new construction?
- How will the AEBA actually affect the grid?

# Executive Summary

Analyzing data from NYISO and the Census Bureau, this report finds that:

- AEBA will increase electricity use from buildings in winter, not summer. Virtually all new buildings already haveair-conditioning.
- Today, New York's grid has significant spare capacity in the winter: the winter peak is only **`r winter_peak_ratio`** of the summer peak.
- The short-term reliability risks identified by NYISO—for the next five years—are all associated with the summer peak.
- Therefore, the AEBA will not contribute to short-term reliability risks. Rather, it will make better use of the grid's spare winter capacity.
- Over the long term, a growing winter peak, driven partly by heating electrification, will eventually exceed the summer peak. (NYISO's estimates vary on when this will happen.)
- However, given New York's current and expected pace of new construction, the AEBA will be responsible for only **7%** of the winter peak growth forecasted by NYISO (in their baseline scenario).

# Findings

## AEBA will increase electricity use in winter, not summer

Starting on January 1, 2026, the All-Electric Building Act requires all new buildings seven stories or fewer to install all-electric appliances.

Most appliances are already electric, so this requirement will only affect those that sometimes consume fossil fuels: stoves, water heaters, and heating systems.

Stoves and water heaters are used year-round, but they consume a negligible amount of electricity: over the course of a month, a heat pump water heater and an induction stove each use around a tenth of the power it takes to cool a home during the summer.[^energy_use]

The electrification of these appliances in new construction would therefore not add a significant load to the grid during the summer.

[^energy_use]: A heat pump water heater and an induction stove consume approximately [75 kWh](https://www.quitcarbon.com/blog/heat-pump-water-heaters) and [60 kWh](https://ciarragadgets.com/blogs/news-1/power-usage-of-induction-cooktop) a month, respectively. By comparison, a central air-conditioning unit in a typical American home consumes about [2,500 kWh](https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/how-much-energy-does-an-air-conditioner-use/) per year—roughly 625 kWh per month during the summer.


Compared to these end-uses, heat pumps consume a significant amount of electricity to provide **heating**. But they do so only during the winter, when the grid has significant spare capacity (see @sec-grid-winter-capacity).

Heat pumps can also provide **cooling**, however. By spurring the adoption of heat pumps in new buildings, would the AEBA therefore increase electricity use during the summer peak, when the grid is most stressed?

**No, because the vast majority of new buildings are already built with air-conditioning.**[^air_conditioning_share]

[^air_conditioning_share]: [88%](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/state/pdf/State%20Air%20Conditioning.pdf) of all homes in New York State had some form of air-conditioning (as of 2020); nationally, [98%](https://eyeonhousing.org/2024/08/hvac-in-new-construction-2023/) of new homes were built with air-conditioning as of 2023.

In fact, NYISO's building electrification summer peak forecasts show no impact from heat pump adoption: "Increases in electric cooling from heat pumps are largely offset by decreasing saturations of central and room air conditioning."[^nyiso_summer_peak]

[^nyiso_summer_peak]: See [p. 3](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26205358-nyiso-gold-book-2025/#document/p16/a2675777) in NYISO's 2025 Gold Book, which contains their updated load forecasts for New York's grid [@nyiso_GoldBook2025_2025].

To sum up: The reliability risks identified by NYISO's recent reports are all associated with summer peaks, when the grid is most stressed. But the AEBA won't worsen the summer peak with new cooling loads, because virtually all new buildings have air-conditioning already.

Instead, by replacing fossil fuel-burning appliances with electric ones, the AEBA will produce new buildings that consume more electricity during the _winter_ than they would have otherwise.

Does New York's grid have enough spare winter capacity to handle this AEBA-induced load growth?

## New York's grid has significant spare capacity in the winter {#sec-grid-winter-capacity}

Over the past ten years, New York's grid-wide winter peak has averaged only `r winter_peak_ratio` of the summer peak.

::: {.column-page-inset}
![NYISO peak hourly load over the last ten years, showing New York's grid-wide winter and summer peaks](img/nyiso_peaks.png){#fig-nyiso-peaks fig-cap="NYISO peak hourly load over the last ten years, showing New York's grid-wide winter and summer peaks. Source: NYISO"}
:::

In other words, at the level of **generation** and **transmission**, around a quarter of the grid's capacity goes unused during the winter.

And since the grid is already sized to handle these summer peaks, there's significant "headroom" for winter peaks to grow up to their level, using existing infrastructure.

What about at the **distribution** level of the grid?

A recent study by Synapse Energy Economics analyzed the capacity of New York's distribution grid to accommodate building electrification.

While the picture varies by utility, the distribution grid as a whole appears to have even more winter headroom than the bulk power grid:

:::{.column-body}
| Utility | Distribution winter peak (MW) | Total estimated winter headroom (MW) | Available winter capacity |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| National Grid | 4,276 | 4,477 | 51% |
| Central Hudson | 796 | 279 | 26% |
| NYSEG and RGE | 3,786 | 3,235 | 46% |
| ConEd | 4,691 | 1,346 | 22% |
| Orange & Rockland | 1,123 | 1,071 | 49% |
| **Total** | **14,673** | **10,408** | **42%** |

:::

For instance, in Central Hudson, 26% of the distribution grid's winter capacity is currently unused. In National Grid, the figure is 51%.

The study concludes: "Existing distribution grids could support residential heat pumps reaching roughly 29 percent to 47 percent of the entire heating fuel stock... with the statewide average of 39 percent."[^nyiso_distribution_grid_headroom]

[^nyiso_distribution_grid_headroom]: See [p. 4](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26207519-synapse-bd-assessment-of-electric-grid-headroom-for-accommodating-building-electrification-2024/?mode=annotating#document/p4/a2675823) of Synapse Energy Economics' distribution headroom report [@takahashi_AssessmentElectricGrid_2024].

Simply put: at present, New York's grid has significant spare winter capacity to accommodate heat pumps in new construction, without triggering reliability problems.

## AEBA will contribute very little to winter peak growth

But what about over the long term?

Once the AEBA comes into effect, every new building built with heat pumps will indeed contribute to the winter peak.

In press interviews, Assemblymember William Conrad has voiced concerns that the AEBA could affect grid reliability in winter, presumably from its impact on the winter peak: "I don't want to have a blackout or a brownout because, especially in the winter, that's just something that I know my constituents and myself could not put up with."[^press_interview]

[^press_interview]: See recent [Spectrum News article](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2025/10/21/moderate-assembly-dems-push-hochul-to-delay-all-electric-buildings-mandate) [@lisa_ModerateAssemblyDems_2025].

So let's examine how much the AEBA will contribute to winter peak growth.

NYISO's recently released long-term reliability report, mentioned prominently in the letter to Gov. Hochul, contains forecasts of how the winter peak will evolve through 2034.[^nyiso_long_term_reliability_report]

Just how quickly the winter peak will grow is uncertain: it depends not only on how quickly heat pumps are installed, but also on the pace at which EVs are adopted, and large loads such as data centers are built.

::: {.callout-note}
To capture this uncertainty, NYISO has provided three scenarios:

- A _baseline_ scenario, where "roughly 75% of residential homes use primary electric space heating by 2050, with similar large-scale adoption in the commercial sector."[^nyiso_baseline_scenario]
- A _low-demand_ scenario, where 55% of buildings electrify by 2050
- A _high-demand_ scenario, compliant with the State's climate goals, where over 95% of buildings electrify by 2050

[^nyiso_long_term_reliability_report]: NYISO's Comprehensive Reliability Plan 2025-2034 [@nyiso_ComprehensiveReliabilityPlan_2025].
relies on winter peak forecasts from NYISO's 2025 Gold Book [@nyiso_GoldBook2025_2025].

[^nyiso_baseline_scenario]: See [p. 12](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26205358-nyiso-gold-book-2025/?mode=annotating#document/p16/a2675824) of NYISO's 2025 Gold Book [@nyiso_GoldBook2025_2025].

But one thing is certain: the AEBA itself will contribute only modestly to winter peak growth.

::: {.column-page-inset}
![NYISO winter peak forecast for the baseline scenario, showing expected growth from 2025 to 2040](img/nyiso_winter_peak_baseline.png){#fig-nyiso-winter-peak-baseline fig-cap="NYISO winter peak forecast for the baseline scenario, showing expected growth from 2025 to 2040"}
:::

Due to building electrification, EV adoption, and new large loads such as data centers, NYISO's baseline scenario expects the _gross_ winter peak to grow from 25 GW in the winter of 2025–2026 to 47 GW in 2039–2040.

::: {.column-margin}
| Year | New Housing Units |
|------|-------------------|
| 2021 | 41,530 |
| 2022 | 49,119 |
| 2023 | 45,561 |
| 2024 | 46,852 |
: New housing units per year in New York State, according to the Census Bureau. {#tbl-new-housing-units}
:::

Our modeling estimates that the AEBA will contribute 1.6 GW to the winter peak in 2040, based on the state's current new construction rate.[^caveat1]

[^caveat1]: Of 45,000 new housing units per year, according to [housing unit data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-total-housing-units.html) from the Census Bureau, and of one square foot of commercial space for every three square feet of new housing, according to [p.2](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26205359-nybc-2023-2025-construction-outlook/#document/p3/a2675825) of NYC Construction Outlook [@nybc_NewYorkCity_2023]. This estimate does not change based on the NYISO scenario, only its share of total winter peak growth within the scenario.

This represents only **7%** of the additional 21.5 GW of gross peak winter demand expected by 2040.

This _gross_ peak demand would be reduced by 5.5 GW due to energy efficiency and behind-the-meter battery storage, for a _net_ winter peak of 38 GW, not 47 GW.

In fact, these demand reductions would offset AEBA's impact on the winter peak in 2040 more than three times over.

The NYISO data reveals another fundamental fact: Building electrification is indeed the leading driver of winter peak growth, responsible for 62% of gross winter peak growth by 2040. **But the overwhelming majority of this growth will be due to retrofits, not new construction.**

The AEBA represents only 19% of the winter peak growth expected from building electrification by 2040.[^caveat] This is because the state's pace of new construction is modest, while the existing building stock is vast.

[^caveat]: While these statements apply specifically to NYISO's baseline scenario, retrofits are the overwhelming driver of building electrification in every scenario.

The bottom line: The AEBA will contribute only minorly to peak growth, **93%** of which will be driven by other trends: building electrification of existing buildings, the adoption of EVs, and the building of data centers and other large loads.

It has long been known that building and vehicle electrification will require upgrades to New York's grid. When they will be needed is unclear: The winter peak has not yet started to grow, due in part to the sluggish pace of building electrification.

But this much is clear: these upgrades will be needed regardless of whether the AEBA is implemented. And delaying the AEBA will not fundamentally shift _when_ those upgrades are needed, given its tiny contribution to peak growth. That will be determined by far larger trends.
