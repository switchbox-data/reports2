## Residential Targeted Electrification

Out of the `r comma(n_blocks_total)` blocks included in the analysis, `r percent(pct_res_blocks_total)`  are fully residential.

After filtering down .... Estimate the the planed pipeline replacement projects would replace `r comma(n_miles)` miles of gas pipeline, affecting `r comma(n_res_units)` residential units.

Of the `r comma(n_res_blocks)` fully residential blocks included in the analysis, `r percent(pct_res_blocks_cheaper)` (`r comma(n_res_blocks_cheaper)`) could be electrified for less than or equal to the cost of PRP. This would remove `r comma(n_res_units_1_0)` residential units from the gas system provide a net savings of `r dollar(total_cost_diff_1_0*-1, scale = 1e-6, suffix = " million", accuracy = 1)`.

An additional `r comma(n_res_blocks_1_to_1_5)` (`r percent(pct_res_blocks_1_to_1_5)` of all residential blocks in the analysis) could be electrified for between 1 and 1.5 times the cost of PRP.

If we consider 1.5 times the cost of PRP as the threshold for electrification, then `r comma(n_res_blocks_0_to_1_5)`, `r percent(pct_res_blocks_0_to_1_5)` of all residential blocks in the analysis would be electrified. This would remove `r comma(n_res_units_1_5)` residential units from the gas system and avoid an estimated `r dollar(prp_total_ce_1_5, scale = 1e-6, suffix = " million", accuracy = 1)` in PRP spending being added to the ratebase. We estimate the additional cost to do so would be `r dollar(total_cost_diff_1_5, scale = 1e-6, suffix = " million", accuracy = 1)`.
