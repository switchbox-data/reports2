# Introduction

# Executive Summary

# Background
- supply vs. delivery rates

- delivery rates are volumetric
- that doesn't mix well with heat pumps (or EVs)
- that's hurting adoption
- which gets in the way of demand flexibility

- supply rates are flat
- but wholesale prices are volatile
- people have no incentive to load shift
- that means, less demand flexibility

# Findings

## When HP customers switch to heat pumps, their bills go up
    - By fuel
- Is this due to commodity prices? No it's mostly due to the distortionary effect of volumetric delivery rates

## HP customers are cross-subsidizing non-HP customers
  - How much?
  - Why does this happen?
  - By utility

- A well-designed HP rate fixes that

- It's a short-term fix, before winter-peaking

## How would the rate need to evolve over time?

## TOU Rates
  - https://github.com/switchbox-data/rate-design-platform/issues/96
- What about time-of-use rates?

- What is a "well-designed TOU rate"?
  - Just aligned with supply marginal costs?
  - Or also delivery peaks, somehow?
  - https://github.com/switchbox-data/rate-design-platform/issues/96

- If you had it, how much lower would bills be—assuming no flexibility?

- If you had it, how much lower would bills be—assuming flexibility?

(- How much better aligned with the cost of service? Supply or delivery?)

## TOU Rates and System investment
- What is the impact on peak growth of TOU—assuming flexibility?
