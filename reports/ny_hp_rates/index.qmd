# Introduction

# Executive Summary

# Background
- supply vs. delivery rates

- delivery rates are volumetric
- that doesn't mix well with heat pumps (or EVs)
- that's hurting adoption
- which gets in the way of demand flexibility

- supply rates are flat
- but wholesale prices are volatile
- people have no incentive to load shift
- that means, less demand flexibility

# Findings

## What happens to heating bills when households change the heat pumps?
- When households who heat with natural gas switch to heat pumps, their bills mostly go up.
- MEDIAN ELECTRIC + GAS BILL, STATEWIDE
- But there's a range
- BILL CHANGE HISTOGRAM
- The range depends on xyz factors, see the appendix.

- When households who heat with delivered fuels switch the heat pumps, their bills go up X% of the time.
- MEDIAN ELECTRIC + GAS BILL, STATEWIDE
- But there's a range
- BILL CHANGE HISTOGRAM

- Is this due to commodity prices? No, it's primarily due to the distortionary effect of volumetric delivery rates

## HP customers are cross-subsidizing non-HP customers

- When a household switches to a heat pump, their electricity consumption goes up ~2x in the winter.
- This means that they pay for 2x for supply, which makes sense: they are consuming twice as much electricity, after all.
- But it also means they pay 2x for delivery, because most delivery costs are recovered through volumetric charges, not fixed charges.
- GRAPHIC OF MEDIAN DELIVERY PAYMENT, before and after heat pumps, by utility
- HISTOGRAM OF DELIVERY PAYMENT PERCENTAGE INCREASE, STATEWIDE?

(- One of the principles of ratemaking is that customers pay for the (delivery) costs they impose on the system. Systematically charging HP customers 2x more than other customers implies that these customers cost twice as much to serve as other customers. But is this true? Likely not:)

- This would make sense if this additional load was triggering the need for grid upgrades.
- But it's not, because there's plenty of spare capacity in the grid during the winter:
  - NYISO summer vs. winter peak (system-wide or by zone?)
  - Synapse study on distribution grid headroom

- This makes it unlikely that the cost to serve heat pump customers is 2x that of non-heat pump customers, which suggests that heat pump customers are systematically paying more than their fair share for the grid, which would create a cross-subsidy to non-heat pump customers.
- Aside: text + infographic on How cross-subsidization works
- To prove it, we need to measure the cost-of-service for heat pump customers, and compare it to the revenue they generate under current rates for each utility. And we do the same for non-heat pump customers.

- For each household, we measure their cost-of-service for delivery, and subtract it from the revenue they pay to the utility. The result is called a household's **bill alignment**.
- Households with negative bill alignment are paying less than their cost-of-service for delivery, and are thereby being subsidized by households with positive bill alignment, who are paying more than their cost-of-service for delivery.
- GRAPHIC: Example of two households with different bill alignments, one is subsidizing the other.
- For full details on how we calculate the cost of service for delivery, see the appendix.

### Findings

- We find that at present, HP customers are systematically paying more than their cost-of-service for delivery: their average cost-of-service is $X per year, compared to $Y per year for non-HP customers, but they pay an average of $Z.
- GRAPHIC: average bill alignment, heat pump vs. non-heat pump customers
- This creates a cross-subsidy to non-HP customers of $X per year, on average.

- This violates Bonbright's principle of fairness: customers pay for the costs they impose on the system.
- And, we'll see, it also is the primary reason that heat pumps cost more to operate than natural gas.

- How this varies by NYC utility
- GRAPHIC

## Heat pump rate

- We propose a new rate for heat pump customers that would fix this fairness problem.
- It would work in the simplest way possible, by reducing the winter delivery rate to a level that maximizes bill alignment for heat pump customers.

- This seasonal rate would need to reflect the cost of service in each utility territory.
- TABLE OF PROPOSED RATES

- ASIDE: why this approach?
- Heat pump-friendly rates are ones that fix this fairness problem.
- Moving much of the delivery payment to fixed charges, as CA has done, would help heat pumps, because their delivery payments before and after electrifying would stay fixed.
- (And you could make this economically equitable by doing income-graduated fixed charges.)
- We're not proposing a change to the default rate, however.
- To make the preserve bill stability for non-HP customer, and keep the rate as simple as possible for HP customers (two other Bonbright values), we're proposing a rate that would apply only to heat pump customers, and would achieve reduced delivery payments by simply lowering the delivery rate, rather than moving most of the cost recovery to a fixed charge, though the financial effect would be largely the same.

- What happens to the bill alignments we saw earlier if all existing heat pump customers opted in to these rates?
- CHART: bill alignment for heat pump vs. non heat pump customers.

- So we know these rates would fix the fairness problem by making delivery rates more cost-reflective.

## Bill impact of heat pump rate
- What would it do to the bills of heat pump customers?
- CHART: bill change histogram for heat pump customers.
- It means most people would save; which is proof that volumetric delivery rates are largely to blame for the higher bills of heat pump customers, not commodity prices.
- This is essential for market transformation.

- All those heat pump customers are currently overpaying, and these overpayments are lowering the bill of non-HP customers.
- It's like there's an invisible credit on their bills.
- How large is this credit? What would be the impact on the bill of non-HP customers if all existing heat pump customers opted in to these rates?
- CHART: bill change histogram for non-heat pump customers.
- Note that this bill change is not really "raising rates" on non-HP customers, it's actually removing a cross-subsidy from them.
- Moreoever, the current subsidy is very small, so the impact on non-HP customers would be very small.
- This shows how bad this (unintended) policy is: because there are few HP customers, the benefits to non-HP customers are very small. But the costs faced by household that wish electrify—which is a policy goal that that state is trying to advance, are very large.

- Okay, but that's true right now, when heat pump adoption is using spare capacity. But at some point, won't the winter peak exceed the summer peak, and heat pumps actually become the main driver of grid investment?
- Yes. That's why this is a short-term fix on purpose, before the grid becomes winter-peaking.
- CHART: winter peak as a function of heat pump adoption, or a series of yearly

- How would the rate need to evolve over time? When would it need to be sunset, and what would be the glide path?

## How would the rate need to evolve over time?

- https://github.com/switchbox-data/rate-design-platform/issues/95

- at some point, as the grid becomes winter-peaking, the cost of service for delivery will start to increase, for the following reasons:

- when do costs accumulate? CHECK for accuracy:
- when total system capacity is breached, requiring new grid investment
- when zonal system capacity is breached, requiring new transmission investment?
- when local substation or feeder capacity is breached, requiring new distribution investment.

- as these things start happening, it means the cost-of-service of heat pumps will start to rise.

- to maintain fairness, the rate would need to stay cost-reflective, which means it would need to start rising.
- the utilities could do this by aligning the distribution delivery rate with yearly MCOSS studies, and the NYISO would do this for generation and transmission by XYZ. (maybe just business as usual?)
- how quickly this happens depends on how quickly HP adoption occurs.

- align with NY-ISO forecasts...
- comment on which one seems the most likely

- comment on how this evolution also depends dramatically on which kind of HP is used

- How should rates evolve as we approach the winter peak?

## TOU Rates
  - https://github.com/switchbox-data/rate-design-platform/issues/96
- What about time-of-use rates?

- What is a "well-designed TOU rate"?
  - Just aligned with supply marginal costs?
  - Or also delivery peaks, somehow?
  - https://github.com/switchbox-data/rate-design-platform/issues/96

- If you had it, how much lower would bills be—assuming no flexibility?

- If you had it, how much lower would bills be—assuming flexibility?

(- How much better aligned with the cost of service? Supply or delivery?)

## TOU Rates and System investment
