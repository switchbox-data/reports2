# Executive Summary




# Background

## What are Line Extension Allowances?

As gas utilities connect new customers, they often need to extend the natural gas distribution system to reach the new customer. This requires investment in both main and service line extensnion. Line extension allowances (LEAs) are ratepayer funded subsidies that reduce the cost of expanding the distribution system to reach new customers. In Illinois, the amount of the LEA subsidy is determined by a maximum footage allowed per customer - 100 or 200 feet for mains (low or high pressure) and 60 feet for service lines. While Illinois Administrative Code requires gas utilities to provide LEA subsidies for urban customers, most utiliites voluntarily extend the same allowances to rural customers.


## Why are states revisiting LEA policies?
Historically, LEAs were established to grow the gas system, allowing utiliies to capitalize on economies of scale in the distribution system. There was an embeded assumption that customers would stay in the system for the long term and costs associated with LEAs would be recouped through increased revenue from the growing customer base.

As states progress towards their climate goals, they are increasingly looking to electrify buildings and transportation systems. Continued expansion of the natural gas system not only runs counter to emissions reduction targets, but also encourages additional capital investment in infrastructure that may no longer be needed in a future with reduced gas demand. [^stranded_assets]

[^stranded_assets]: "Stranded assets" refers to gas infrastructure—such as pipelines or distribution networks—that is rendered obsolete or uneconomic before the end of its expected useful life because customers shift away from natural gas, potentially leaving a shrinking utility ratepayers responsible for paying off investments in infrastructure they no longer use.

Eight states have passed or are currently considering legislation to limit or phase out LEA spending at the time of this report. The Illinois Commerce Commission has expressed interest in reviewing LEA policies as part of it's on going work on the Future of Gas. .

# LEA Spending in Illinois
There is limited data on what gas utilities in Illinois are spending on LEA projects. We present a mix of data including historical and forecasted spending data collected from ratecases and best estimates for missing data. [^data_sources]

[^data_sources]: For more details on the data presented please see table TK in TKAPPENDIX.


## Nicor
From `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "nicor_main_historical")` to `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "nicor_main_historical")`, Nicor averaged `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "nicor_main_historical")` per year on main LEA subsidies and `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "nicor_service_historical")` per year on service line subsidies.
Nicor is forcasted to spend `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")` per year on LEA subsidies between `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")` and `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")`, totaling `r fetch_spending_vars("total", total_spending, "nicor_combined_forecast")` over the next 5 years.

Nicor reported spending an average of TK per new connection on LEA subsidies for main extension allowances in 2023. This figure does not include service line extensions. Over the years reported, cost per connection increased on average by TK per year.

## Peoples Gas

From `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "peoples_main_historical")` to `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "peoples_main_historical")`, Peoples Gas averaged `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_main_historical")` per year on main LEA subsidies and `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_service_historical")` per year on service line subsidies. Average annual forecasted spending for `r fetch_spending_vars("from", total_spending, "peoples_main_forecast")` to `r fetch_spending_vars("to", total_spending, "peoples_main_forecast")` was `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_main_forecast")` per year on main extensioins and `r fetch_spending_vars("avg_cost", total_spending, "peoples_service_forecast")` per year on service line extensions.

## Ameren

Ameren has not reported LEA spending
as of this report - main line extension double other gas utilities (current rate case proposes reduction from 400 to 200 miles)
report TK on expansion of distribution system (TK)
