# Introduction

# Executive Summary

# Background
## Rate 101
- supply vs. delivery rates

## The fairness problem
- Delivery rates are volumetric
- That doesn't mix well with heat pumps (or EVs): when your load doubles, you delivery payments do too, even when your cost-of-service doesn't, so you pay more than your fair share.
- And by artificially increasing heat pump operating costs, that's hurting heat pump adoption (and it also affects EVs).
- And since heat pumps, electric water heaters, and EVs account for much of the demand flexibility potential in Brattle's study, this fairness problem is actually another obstacle to unlocking demand flexibility in NY.

## The cost-reflectiveness problem
- Then there's the fact that rates, which are an important way to achieve demand flexibility, are not currently doing so, because they're not cost-reflective.
- The problem occurs on both the supply and delivery sides of the bill.
- Wholesale electricy prices are volatile, reflecting that the underlying cost of generating electricity changes based on the demand level and the availability of different types of generators.
- However, supply rates are flat, so customers have no incentive shift their load to take advantage of lower prices, and reduce the need for costly and polluting peaker generators.
- Similarly, the need for new grid capacity is largely driven by demand during peak periods.
- But delivery rates are also flat, so customers have no incentive to load shift away from these periods, and thus right-size the infrastructure needed to serve them.

# Findings

## What happens to heating bills when households change the heat pumps?
- When households who heat with natural gas switch to heat pumps, their bills mostly go up.
- BAR CHART: MEDIAN ELECTRIC + GAS BILL, STATEWIDE

- But there's a range
- HISTOGRAM: BILL CHANGE, STATEWIDE, for natural gas customers.
- The range depends on xyz factors, see the appendix.

- But only X% of NY households are heated with natural gas, the rest are heated with electricity (mostly resistance) or delivered fuels
- BAR CHART: households by heating fuel type.

- When households who heat with delivered fuels switch to heat pumps, their bills go down.
- BAR CHART: MEDIAN ELECTRIC + GAS BILL, STATEWIDE
- But not in every case.
- HISTOGRAM: BILL CHANGE, STATEWIDE, for natural gas customers.

- Is this due to commodity prices?
- No, it's primarily due to the distortionary effect of volumetric delivery rates, as we'll see in the next section.

## HP customers are cross-subsidizing non-HP customers

- When a household switches to a heat pump, their electricity consumption goes up ~2x in the winter.
- This means that they pay for 2x for supply, which makes sense: they are consuming twice as much electricity, after all.
- But it also means they pay 2x for delivery, because most delivery costs are recovered through volumetric charges, not fixed charges.

- GRAPHIC OF MEDIAN DELIVERY PAYMENT, before and after heat pumps, by utility
- HISTOGRAM OF DELIVERY PAYMENT PERCENTAGE INCREASE, STATEWIDE?

(- One of the principles of ratemaking is that customers pay for the (delivery) costs they impose on the system. Systematically charging HP customers 2x more than other customers implies that these customers cost twice as much to serve as other customers. But is this true? Likely not:)

- This would make sense if this additional load was triggering the need for grid upgrades.
- But it's not, because there's plenty of spare capacity in the grid during the winter:
  - NYISO summer vs. winter peak (system-wide or by zone?)
  - Synapse study on distribution grid headroom

- This makes it unlikely that the cost to serve heat pump customers is 2x that of non-heat pump customers, which suggests that heat pump customers are systematically paying more than their fair share for the grid, which would create a cross-subsidy to non-heat pump customers.
- Aside: text + infographic on How cross-subsidization works
- To prove it, we need to measure the cost-of-service for heat pump customers, and compare it to the revenue they generate under current rates for each utility. And we do the same for non-heat pump customers.

- For each household, we measure their cost-of-service for delivery, and subtract it from the revenue they pay to the utility. The result is called a household's **bill alignment**.
- Households with negative bill alignment are paying less than their cost-of-service for delivery, and are thereby being subsidized by households with positive bill alignment, who are paying more than their cost-of-service for delivery.

- GRAPHIC: Example of two households with different bill alignments, one is subsidizing the other.
- For full details on how we calculate the cost of service for delivery, see the appendix.

### Findings

- We find that at present, HP customers are systematically paying more than their cost-of-service for delivery: their average cost-of-service is $X per year, compared to $Y per year for non-HP customers, but they pay an average of $Z.
- GRAPHIC: average bill alignment, heat pump vs. non-heat pump customers
- This creates a cross-subsidy to non-HP customers of $X per year, on average.

- This violates Bonbright's principle of fairness: customers pay for the costs they impose on the system.
- And, we'll see, it also is the primary reason that heat pumps cost more to operate than natural gas.

- How this varies by NYC utility
- GRAPHIC

## Proposal: fair rate for heat pump customers

- We propose a new rate for heat pump customers that would fix this fairness problem.
- It would work in the simplest way possible, by reducing the winter delivery rate to a level that maximizes bill alignment for heat pump customers.

- This seasonal rate would need to reflect the cost of service in each utility territory.
- TABLE OF PROPOSED RATES FOR EACH UTILITY
- OPEN QUESTION: DO WE JUST SHOW DELIVERY RATES HERE?

- CALLOUT BOX WITH ASIDE: why this approach of seasonal rate adjustment?
- Heat pump-friendly rates are ones that fix this fairness problem.
- Moving much of the delivery payment to fixed charges, as CA has done, would help heat pumps, because their delivery payments before and after electrifying would stay fixed.
- (And you could make this economically equitable by doing income-graduated fixed charges.)
- We're not proposing a change to the default rate, however.
- To make the preserve bill stability for non-HP customer, and keep the rate as simple as possible for HP customers (two other Bonbright values), we're proposing a rate that would apply only to heat pump customers, and would achieve reduced delivery payments by simply lowering the delivery rate, rather than moving most of the cost recovery to a fixed charge, though the financial effect would be largely the same.

- What happens to the bill alignments we saw earlier if all existing heat pump customers opted in to these rates?
- CHART: bill alignment for heat pump vs. non heat pump customers.

- So we know these rates would fix the fairness problem by making delivery rates more cost-reflective.

## Bill impact of heat pump rate on HP customers

- What would it do to the bills of heat pump customers?
- CHART: bill change histogram for heat pump customers.
- It means most people would save; which is proof that volumetric delivery rates are largely to blame for the higher bills of heat pump customers, not commodity prices.
- This is essential for market transformation.

- All those heat pump customers are currently overpaying, and these overpayments are lowering the bill of non-HP customers.
- It's like there's an invisible credit on their bills.
- How large is this credit? What would be the impact on the bill of non-HP customers if all existing heat pump customers opted in to these rates?
- CHART: bill change histogram for non-heat pump customers.
- Note that this bill change is not really "raising rates" on non-HP customers, it's actually removing a cross-subsidy from them.
- Moreover, the current subsidy is very small, so the impact on non-HP customers would be very small.
- This shows how bad this (unintended) policy is: because there are few HP customers, the benefits to non-HP customers are very small. But the costs faced by household that wish electrify—which is a policy goal that that state is trying to advance, are very large.

- Okay, but that's true right now, when heat pump adoption is using spare capacity. But at some point, won't the winter peak exceed the summer peak, and heat pumps actually become the main driver of grid investment?
- Yes. That's why this is a short-term fix on purpose, before the grid becomes winter-peaking.
- CHART: winter peak as a function of heat pump adoption, or a series of yearly

## Bill impact of heat pump rate on non-HP customers

- As we saw earlier, non-HP customers are currently being subsidized by heat pump customers, because heat pump customers are paying more than their cost-of-service for delivery. In other words, rates for all customers are currently too lower, because the overpayment of HP customers allows the utility to collect their residential revenue requirement by spreading a lower rate over more kWh.
- If all heat pump customers opted in to heat pump-only seasonal rates, these overpayments would be removed, and the default rate used by non-HP customers would need to increase.
- Note that this bill change is not a "rate hike" on non-HP customers, rather, it would simply remove a subsidy, and better align the rate with their cost-of-service for delivery.
- But given the small number of HP customers, the impact on their bills from removing the subsidy would be negligible:
- CHART: bill change histogram for non-heat pump customers.

- This shows how bad this (unintended) policy is: because there are few HP customers, the benefits to non-HP customers are very small. But the costs faced by household that wish electrify—which is a policy goal that that state is trying to advance, are very large.
- This won't be true forever, however: as heat pump adoption increases, the number of HP customers will increase, and the subsidy to non-HP customers will become larger. So this is the time to fix this fairness problem, before it becomes politically intractable to fix it.


## How would the rate need to evolve over time?

- The idea of making rates fair for heat pump customers by offering them a special rate that avoids overcollecting delivery costs from them assumes that heat pump adoption is not a driver of grid investment. As we have shown, this is true at present, when heat pump adoption is using spare winter capacity.
- However, heat pump adoption is still the main driver of winter peak growth. And once the winter peak starts growing faster than the summer peak, at some point it will catch up. Once this happens, heat pump adoption will become the main driver of grid investment.
- And keeping rates fair will mean continuing to align revenue from heat pump customers with their cost-of-service for delivery, which will now be higher than not heat pump customers.
- This means that this rate is a short-term fix. It needs a glide path to evolve as the underlying cost-of-service of heat pump customers changes, and will need to be sunset as the grid becomes winter-peaking.

- How quickly heat pump adoption will tip the various zones of NY's grid into winter-peaking is unclear—it depends on the pace of heat pump adoption, and the performance of the equipment being adopted.

- Rather than trying to forecast _when_ the grid will become winter-peaking, estimate _at what level of heat pump adoption_ this change will occur, for different heat pump technologies.
- And we show how the rate would need to evolve as heat pump adoption increases, to keep rates fair.

- CHART: winter peak growth (vs summer peak) for low-performance ASHP, high-performance ASHP, and GSHP.
- CHART: how HP customer cost-of-service and rate would need to evolve as heat pump adoption increases (for each technology), to keep rates fair.
- APPENDIX: How this varies by NYISO zone and utility.

- Discussion of how cost-of-service and rates would need to evolve over time, and how things flip after the winter peak becomes larger than the summer peak.

- OPEN QUESTION: do the adoption scenarios assume everything but heat pump adoption is static, or do we try to align with NYISO load forecasts to include other sources of peak growth for both the summer and winter peaks? (If so, which forecast is really reasonable?)
- OPEN QUESTION: how do we estimate the distribution cost-of-service change over time, as these marginal costs would likely kick in first?


## Time-varying Rates
  - https://github.com/switchbox-data/rate-design-platform/issues/96

- The Grid of the Future proceeding is about unlocking demand flexibility in NY, partly through time-varying rates like time-of-use and CPP.

- When heat pump seasonal rates are fundamentally about fairness—making sure we don't overcharge heat pump customers—time-varying rates are about economic efficiency, two distinct kinds:
  - **Consumption efficiency**: making energy prices more reflective of the underlying cost of generating electricity, so that consumers use more electricity when it's cheaper to generate (like when the sun is shining), and less when it's more expensive (like when peakers are running).
  - **Investment efficiency**: making network prices more reflective of the underlying cost of expanding grid capacity, so that consumers reduce electricity use during peak demand periods, thereby reducing the need for investments in grid capacity (whether in generation, transmission, or distribution).

- Time-varying rates achieve these **energy** and **capacity investment deferral** benefits by making electricity bills more **cost-reflective**, in the sense that they more closely reflect the underlying incremental cost of generating electricity (also known as marginal energy costs) and expanding grid capacity (also known as marginal capacity costs).

- To the extent that heating loads are flexible—an open question at this time—time-varying rates could help heat pump customers lower their bills by shifting load to off-peak periods. And they could unlock lower delivery rates for all customers, once the NYISO grid become winter peak, by slowing the growth of the winter peak, and thus reducing capacity investment needs.

- In other words, fair rates and time-varying rates are both essential for **beneficial electrification**: while seasonal discounts could lower heat pump bills by paying for _past_ grid capacity investments more fairly, time-varying rates could lower heat pump bills by allowing heat pump customers to pre-heat their homes when electrons are cheap, while also reducing the need for _future_ grid capacity investments—thereby limiting bill growth for all.

- Happily, these rates can be combined: you can have time-of-use rates that are lower for heat pump customers in the winter, for instance. We do so in this section.

- Importantly, however, the relationship between fair rates and demand flexibility goes deeper: most of the demand flexibility potential that Brattle says is possible by 2040 is provided by high levels of EVs, heat pumps, and electric water heaters. At the moment, adoption of these technologies isn't happening fast enough for those demand flexibility opportunities to be realized. And this is partly because unfair rates are artificially increasing the operating costs of these technologies, particularly heat pumps.

- That means that fair rates aren't just about fairness and affordability for heat pump customers in the near-term, they're also essential to unlocking grid-wide demand flexibility in the long-term.

### Designing a TOU rate

- A well-designed TOU rate needs periods and levels that are as closely aligned as possible with both marginal energy and marginal capacity costs.
- Let's look at those costs first.

- CHARTS: Statewide 8760 heat map of marginal energy costs, generation capacity costs, transmission capacity costs, and distribution capacity costs.
- (Heat maps for each zone-utility combination are in the appendix.)

- Marginal energy costs are just the wholesale price of electricity from the NYISO spot market. They vary hour by hour, as different generators with different costs are dispatched to meet shifting demand. They mostly range from $TK to $TK per MWh, reaching a peak of $TK per MWh during summer afternoons.
- Marginal generation capacity costs reflect the cost of adding a new megawatt of generation capacity to the NYISO system. They are zero most of the year, but spike during summer afternoons, when generation capacity approaches its peak. They are estimated by allocating the cost of the previous year's capacity auction to the top hundred hours of the year, and then dividing by the number of hours in the year. They mostly range from $TK to $TK per MWh, reaching a peak of $TK per MWh during summer afternoons.
- Marginal transmission capacity costs reflect the cost of adding a new megawatt of transmission capacity to the NYISO system. They are zero most of the year, but spike during summer afternoons, when transmission capacity approaches its peak. Different transmission zones have different monthly patterns. They are estimated by XYZ. They mostly range from $TK to $TK per MWh, reaching a peak of $TK per MWh during summer afternoons.
- Marginal distribution capacity costs are the cost of adding a new megawatt of distribution capacity to the NYISO system. Technically, every feeder has a heatmap that looks like this, and they may each peak at different times, meaning marginal distribution capacity costs vary by feeder. We average them together to produce a single 8760 heatmap for each utility, which is then averaged across utilities to produce a statewide 8760 heatmap. They mostly range from $TK to $TK per MWh, reaching a peak of $TK per MWh during summer afternoons.

- For each utility in NYS, we've designed time-of-use rates specifically for heat pump customers that are as closely aligned as possible with both marginal energy and marginal capacity costs. And we've designed these rates to be fair, so that they also remove the cross-subsidy from HP customers to non-HP customers that exists today. (In other words, these rates would collect the same amount of revenue from heat pump customers as the seasonal discount rates we proposed earlier.)

- DIAGRAM: Time-of-use rates for heat pump customers, by utility.

- If customers installing heat pumps opted in to these rates, how much lower would their bills be?
- It depends if we assume that they shift their heating and cooling to off-peak periods, which would produce lower bills.

- We present bill change results under two different assumptions:
  - No flexibility: customers don't shift their heating and cooling to off-peak periods.
  - Flexibility: customers shift their heating and cooling to off-peak periods, without affecting their comfort.

- CHART: bill change histogram for heat pump customers, under default rates vs. fair rates vs. time-of-use + fair rates with no flexibility vs. time-of-use + fair rates with flexibility.

- Discussion of time-of-use rates with no flexibility: compared to the standard fair rates, adding a time-of-use component and assuming no behavioral change lowers / raises bill slightly, due to the fact that electricity consumption is highest when electrons are cheapest / most expensive.
- Discussion of time-of-use rates with flexibility: compared to time-of-use with no flexibility, if we assume that heat pump customers shift their heating and cooling to off-peak periods, without affecting their comfort, the bill savings are more pronounced.
- Note that these are bookend scenarios, and the reality is likely to fall somewhere in between. However, this also suggests that maximizing the pairing of heat pumps with smart thermostats should be a policy priority, as it enhances heat pump affordability.

- OPEN QUESTION: we're assuming that we design the tou + fair rate to collect the same amount of revenue as the fair rate, but are we doing this assuming flexibility or not?
- To the extent flexibility actually lowers marginal capacity costs for HP customers, due to lower cooling demand, it would actually be okay to collect less revenue from HP customers.

- OPEN QUESTION: would these customers be "better align with the cost of service"? Or, if we collect the same amount of revenue from them as under fair rates, perhaps the difference isn't cost-of-service alignment, but better cost-reflectiveness: supply rates are higher when electrons are expensive (and presumably more supply revenue is collected in these periods, since we don't expect elasticities to be that large), and delivery rates are higher when demand triggers capacity upgrades (and presumably more delivery revenue is collected from these periods as well).

## TOU Rates and System investment

- Since our time-of-use rates are aligned with marginal capacity costs, not just marginal energy costs, any amount of load shifting they induce away from peak periods may have some effect on reducing the need for capacity investments.
- How large is this effect? How does it vary by technology?

- LINE CHART: winter peak growth for as a function of heat pump adoption under TOU rates, with and without flexibility, for low-performance ASHP, high-performance ASHP, and GSHP.

- Discussion of the capacity investment deferral impact before winter peak exceeds summer peak.
- Discussion of the capacity investment deferral impact after winter peak exceeds summer peak.

- OPEN QUESTION: do we need to add CPP rates to really capture this effect? Or is TOU sufficiently aligned, given the limits of heat pump flexibility?
- OPEN QUESTION: how do we translate the effect on peak growth into a dollar benefit? (For instance, if we can reduce the need for capacity investments by 10%, how much money can we save, and how much of that comes from energy vs. generation capacity vs. transmission capacity vs. distribution capacity?)
