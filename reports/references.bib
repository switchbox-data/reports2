  abstract = {Electrification and the growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, are changing the energy landscape of electric distribution systems and creating new challenges and opportunities for electric utilities. Changes in demand profiles require improvements in distribution system load models, which have not historically accounted for device controllability or impacts on customer comfort. Although building modeling research has focused on these features, there is a need to incorporate them into distribution load models that include DERs and can be used to study grid-interactive buildings. In this paper, we present the Object-oriented, Controllable, High-resolution Residential Energy (OCHRE) model. OCHRE is a controllable thermal-electric residential energy model that captures building thermal dynamics, integrates grid-dependent electrical behavior, contains models for common DERs and end-use loads, and simulates at a time resolution down to 1 minute. It includes models for space heaters, air conditioners, water heaters, electric vehicles, photovoltaics, and batteries that are externally controllable and integrated in a co-simulation framework. Using a proposed zero energy ready community in Colorado, we co-simulate a distribution grid and 498 all-electric homes with a diverse set of efficiency levels and equipment properties. We show that controllable devices can reduce peak demand within a neighborhood by up to 73\% during a critical peak period without sacrificing occupant comfort. We also demonstrate the importance of modeling load diversity at a high time resolution when quantifying power and voltage fluctuations across a distribution system.},

  abstract = {For many households, energy consumption represents a non-discretionary portion of their budget and directly relates to quality of life. As researchers continue to study the environmental impacts of energy behavior, it is important to explore how energy consumption relates to socio-economic wellbeing. This paper examines the economic impacts of being energy-burdened in the United States, defined as spending at least 10\% of household income on heating and electricity services; energy burdens are partially, but not entirely, driven by income, since energy needs and costs can vary substantially due to housing characteristics, utility rates, and other factors. Using panel data of US household income and energy expenditures during 1999–2017, this analysis demonstrates that energy-burdened households were at about 150\%–200\% greater risk of transitioning into or extending the duration of economic poverty over a two-year timeframe relative to non-burdened households. This analysis indicates that dedicating inordinate amounts of income to energy services can threaten a household’s economic well-being over time, possibly by preventing a household from engaging in other economic activities or compounding existing economic hardship. These results emphasize the importance of energy assistance and energy efficiency for low-income households, drawing attention to how structures of energy consumption, the welfare state, and social stratification intertwine.},

  abstract = {This article statistically isolates the impacts of city-level permitting and other local regulatory processes on residential PV prices in the United States. We combine data from two “scoring” mechanisms that independently capture local regulatory process efficiency with the largest dataset of installed PV prices in the United States. We find that variations in local permitting procedures can lead to differences in average residential PV prices of approximately \$0.18/W between the jurisdictions with the least-favorable and most-favorable permitting procedures. Between jurisdictions with scores across the middle 90\% of the range (i.e., 5th percentile to 95th percentile), the difference is \$0.14/W, equivalent to a \$700 (2.2\%) difference in system costs for a typical 5-kW residential PV installation. When considering variations not only in permitting practices, but also in other local regulatory procedures, price differences grow to \$0.64–\$0.93/W between the least-favorable and most-favorable jurisdictions. Between jurisdictions with scores across the middle 90\% of the range, the difference is equivalent to a price impact of at least \$2500 (8\%) for a typical 5-kW residential PV installation. These results highlight the magnitude of cost reduction that might be expected from streamlining local regulatory regimes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents evidence that gasoline prices have a larger effect on demand for electric vehicles (EVs) than electricity prices in California. We match a spatially-disaggregated panel dataset of monthly EV registration records to detailed records of gasoline and electricity prices in California from 2014-2017, and use these to estimate the effect of energy prices on EV demand. Two distinct empirical approaches (panel fixed-effects and a utility-border discontinuity) yield remarkably similar results: a given change in gasoline prices has roughly four to six times the effect on EV demand as a similar percentage change in electricity prices. We explore the implications for optimal EV subsidies, which promote externality reduction benefits and correct for consumer mis-optimization stemming from the undervaluation of future electricity costs.},

  abstract = {PUDL v2024.2.6 Data Release The main impetus behind this release is the quarterly update of some of ourcore datasets with preliminary data for 2023Q4. The EIA Form 860 – Annual Electric Generator Report, EPA Hourly Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS), and bulk EIA API data are all up to date through the end of 2023, while the EIA Form 923 – Power Plant Operations Report lags a month behind and is currently only available through November, 2023. We also addressed several issues we found in our initial release automation process that will make it easier for us to do more frequent releases, like this one! We’re also for the first time publishing the full historical time series of of generator data available in the EIA860M, rather than just using the most recent release to update the EIA860 outputs. This enables tracking of how planned fossil plant retirement dates have evolved over time. There are also updates to our data validation system, a new version of Pandas, and experimental Parquet outputs. See below for the details. New Data Coverage Add EIA860M data through December 2023 \#3313, \#3367. Add 2023 Q4 of CEMS data. See \#3315, \#3379. Add EIA923 monthly data through November 2023 \#3314, \#3398, \#3422. Create a new table core\_eia860m\_\_changelog\_generators which tracks the evolution of all generator data reported in the EIA860M, in particular the stated retirement dates. see issue \#3330 and PR \#3331. Previously only the most recent month of reported EIA860M data was available within the PUDL DB. Release Infrastructure Use the same logic to merge version tags into the stable branch as we are using to merge the nightly build tags into the nightly branch. See PR \#3347 Automatically place a temporary object hold on all versioned data releases that we publish to GCS, to ensure that they can’t be accidentally deleted. See issue \#3400 and PR \#3421. Schema Changes Restored the individual FERC Form 1 plant output tables, providing direct access to denormalized versions of the specific plant types via: out\_ferc1\_\_yearly\_steam\_plants\_sched402 out\_ferc1\_\_yearly\_small\_plants\_sched410 out\_ferc1\_\_yearly\_hydroelectric\_plants\_sched406 out\_ferc1\_\_yearly\_pumped\_storage\_plants\_sched408 See issue \#3416 \& PR \#3417 Data Validation with Pandera We’ve started integrating pandera dataframe schemas and checks with dagster asset checks to validate data while our ETL pipeline is running instead of only after all the data has been produced. Initially we are using the various database schema checks that are generated by our metadata, but the goal is to migrate all of our data validation tests into this framework over time, and to start using it to encode any new data validations immediately. See issues \#941, \#1572, \#3318, \#3412 and PR \#3282. Pandas 2.2 We’ve updated to Pandas 2.2, which has a number of changes and deprecations. See PRs \#3272, \#3410. Changes in how merge results are sorted impacted the assignment of unit\_id\_pudl values, so any hard-coded values that dependent on the previous assignments will likely be incorrect now. We had to update a number of tests and FERC1-EIA record linkage training data to account for this change. Pandas is also deprecating the use of the AS frequency alias, in favor of YS, so many references to the old alias have been updated. We’ve switched to using the calamine engine for reading Excel files, which is much faster than the old openpyxl library. Parquet Outputs The ETL now outputs PyArrow Parquet files for all tables that are written to the PUDL DB. The Parquet outputs are used as the interim storage for the ETL, rather than reading all tables out of the SQLite DB. We aren’t publicly distributing the Parquet outputs yet, but are giving them a test run with some existing users. See \#3102 \#3296, \#3399.

  abstract = {Future energy systems could rely on hydrogen (H2) to achieve decarbonisation and net-zero goals. In a similar energy landscape to natural gas, H2 emissions occur along the supply chain. It has been studied how current gas infrastructure can support H2, but there is little known about how H2 emissions affect global warming as an indirect greenhouse gas. In this work, we have estimated for the first time the potential emission profiles (g CO2eq/MJ H2,HHV) of H2 supply chains, and found that the emission rates of H2 from H2 supply chains and methane from natural gas supply are comparable, but the impact on global warming is much lower based on current estimates. This study also demonstrates the critical importance of establishing mobile H2 emission monitoring and reducing the uncertainty of short-lived H2 climate forcing so as to clearly address H2 emissions for net-zero strategies.},

  abstract = {For decades, the world’s governments have struggled to move from talk to action on climate. Many now hope that growing public concern will lead to greater policy ambition, but the most widely promoted strategy to address the climate crisis – the use of market-based programs – hasn’t been working and isn’t ready to scale. Danny Cullenward and David Victor show how the politics of creating and maintaining market-based policies render them ineffective nearly everywhere they have been applied. Reforms can help around the margins, but markets’ problems are structural and won’t disappear with increasing demand for climate solutions. Facing that reality requires relying more heavily on smart regulation and industrial policy – government-led strategies –~to catalyze the transformation that markets promise, but rarely deliver.},

  abstract = {One concern with subsidies for low-carbon technologies is that they tend to go predominantly to high-income households. Previous research has shown, for example, that the top income quintile receives 60\% of subsidies for rooftop solar and 90\% of subsidies for electric vehicles. This paper finds that heat pumps are an important exception. Using newly available U.S. nationally representative data, the paper finds that there is remarkably little correlation between heat pump adoption and household income. Nationwide, 14\% of U.S. households have a heat pump as their primary heating equipment, and adoption levels are essentially identical for all income levels ranging from the bottom of the income distribution ({$<$}30,000 annually) to the top (150,000+). Instead, the paper shows that heat pump adoption is strongly correlated with geography, climate, and electricity prices.},

  abstract = {Understanding residential heating and cooling access - two services necessary for home habitability and health - is a critical but underexplored dimension of equitable climate mitigation efforts. In this paper focusing on Northern California, we ask how residential heating and cooling (space conditioning) usage is distributed socioeconomically and in relation to projected heating and cooling degree days. This work contributes methodologically by extending existing methods of detecting household space conditioning usage. Additionally, this paper finds that access to the services that heat pumps are meant to deliver – residential heating and cooling – are, themselves, uneven: income, tenure, and linguistic isolation, among other factors, can explain whether households consistently heat or cool, and that heating and cooling use demonstrate similar socioeconomic patterns. We suggest that equitable electrification efforts should encompass more than adoption of individual technologies like heat pumps: it is also necessary to examine the extent to which the services that adoption programs are meant to provide – space heating and cooling – are, themselves, inequitably accessed.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen holds tremendous potential to decarbonize many economic sectors, from chemical and material industries to energy storage and generation. However, hydrogen is a tiny, leak-prone molecule that can indirectly warm the climate. Thus, hydrogen emissions from its value chain (production, conversion, transportation/distribution, storage, and end-use) could considerably undermine the anticipated climate benefits of a hydrogen economy. Several studies have identified value chain components that may intentionally and/or unintentionally emit hydrogen.However, the amount of hydrogen emitted from infrastructure is unknown as emissions have not yet been empirically quantified. Without the capacity to make accurate direct measurements, over the past two decades, some studies have attempted to estimate total value chain and component-level hydrogen emissions using various approaches, e.g., assumptions, calculations via proxies, laboratory experiments, and theory-based models (simulations). Here, we synthesize these studies to provide an overview of the available knowledge on hydrogen emissions across value chains. Briefly, the largest ranges in estimated emissions rates are associated with liquefaction (0.15\% to 10\%), liquid hydrogen transporting and handling (2\% to 20\%), and liquid hydrogen refueling (2\% to 15\%). Moreover, present and future value chain emission rate estimates vary widely (0.2\% to 20\%). Field measurements of hydrogen emissions throughout the value chain are critically needed to sharpen our understanding of hydrogen emissions and, with them, accurately assess the climate impact of hydrogen deployment.},

  abstract = {We estimate postmeter methane (CH4) emissions from California’s residential natural gas (NG) system using measurements and analysis from a sample of homes and appliances. Quiescent whole-house emissions (i.e., pipe leaks and pilot lights) were measured using a mass balance method in 75 California homes, while CH4 to CO2 emission ratios were measured for steady operation of individual combustion appliances and, separately, for transient operation of three tankless water heaters. Measured quiescent whole-house emissions are typically {$<$}1 g CH4/day, though they exhibit long-tailed gamma distributions containing values {$>$}10 g CH4/day. Most operating appliances yield undetectable CH4 to CO2 enhancements in steady operation ({$<$}0.01\% of gas consumed), though storage water heaters and stovetops exhibit long-tailed gamma distributions containing high values (∼1–3\% of gas consumed), and transients are observed for the tankless heaters. Extrapolating results to the state-level using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling combined with California housing statistics and gas use information suggests quiescent house leakage of 23.4 (13.7–45.6, at 95\% confidence) Gg CH4, with pilot lights contributing ∼30\%. Emissions from steady operation of appliances and their pilots are 13.3 (6.6–37.1) Gg CH4/yr, an order of magnitude larger than current inventory estimates, with transients likely increasing appliance emissions further. Together, emissions from residential NG are 35.7 (21.7–64.0) Gg CH4/yr, equivalent to ∼15\% of California’s NG CH4 emissions, suggesting leak repair, improvement of combustion appliances, and adoption of nonfossil energy heating sources can help California meet its 2050 climate goals.},

We adopt a novel whole system modelling approach that combines meteorology-driven hourly simulations of demand and supply with storage, flexible technologies, and interconnections on the European scale. Our results show that systems with heat supply based on consumer or district heat pumps require about four times less electricity per unit of heat, with a heat cost about half of that from electrolytic hydrogen boilers. Furthermore, we compare trade-offs between investment in different infrastructure components. For example, we find that, compared to the reference scenario, increasing renewable capacity by 33\%, or interconnections by 200\%, can lower system storage capacity by up to 50\%.},

Transportation and storage of hydrogen are critical to its large-scale adoption and to these ends liquid hydrogen is being widely considered. The liquefaction and storage processes must, however, be both safe and efficient for liquid hydrogen to be viable as an energy carrier. Identifying the most promising liquefaction processes and associated transport and storage technologies is therefore crucial; these need to be considered in terms of a range of interconnected parameters ranging from energy consumption and appropriate materials usage to considerations of unique liquid-hydrogen physics (in the form of ortho–para hydrogen conversion) and boil-off gas handling. This study presents the current state of liquid hydrogen technology across the entire value chain whilst detailing both the relevant underpinning science (e.g. the quantum behaviour of hydrogen at cryogenic temperatures) and current liquefaction process routes including relevant unit operation design and efficiency. Cognisant of the challenges associated with a projected hydrogen liquefaction plant capacity scale-up from the current 32 tonnes per day to greater than 100 tonnes per day to meet projected hydrogen demand, this study also reflects on the next-generation of liquid-hydrogen technologies and the scientific research and development priorities needed to enable them.},

  abstract = {Energy storage systems are becoming one of the most relevant technologies to effectively support renewable energy source (RES) deployment at large. The present work proposes a detailed ageing and energy analysis based on a data-driven empirical approach of a real utility-scale grid-connected lithium-ion battery energy storage system (LIBESS) for providing power grid services. The system under investigation is an operative utility-scale LIBESS integrated with a multi-MW PV plant and connected to the medium voltage network, located in Southern-Italy. The ageing and energy analysis has been performed using data measured by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system directly connected with the LIBESS. This large amount of data is collected in a cloud database and then elaborated using proper software tools. This experimental campaign applied on a commercial LIBESS covers the impact of degradation mechanisms, such as cycle and calendar ageing, the battery and global system efficiency as well as the role of auxiliaries' power consumption under normal and power grid services operations. Thanks to the low complexity of the proposed data-driven model, it could be easily replicated in any other LIBESS facility, both operative in real-world framework and in laboratory context. The state-of-health (SOH) estimated by the degradation model implemented in this work after 3~years of operations and after 356 full-cycles equivalents is equal to 95.88~\%, with an average capacity loss compared to the nominal capacity of about 1.37~\% per year. Energy analysis revealed an average system global efficiency of 85~\% for operations close to the nominal power that decreases to 65~\% for operations at low power rates. While considering the grid network services operations, the power grid applications investigated are primary frequency regulation, secondary voltage regulation and PV unbalances reduction. Our results show that primary frequency regulation is the most efficient service in terms of ageing and energy performances. It has been evaluated a capacity loss of 0.03 kWh per each full-cycle equivalent performed during primary frequency regulation. Differently, secondary voltage regulation and PV unbalances reduction present a capacity loss of 0.1 kWh and of 0.05 kWh per each full-cycle equivalent, respectively. At the same time, the global efficiency of primary regulation (around 83~\%) is remarkably higher compared to secondary voltage regulation (about 47~\%) and to PV unbalances reduction (about 55~\%). Results support the relevance to identify the most impacting key performance indicators for effective exploitation of LIBESS in power system and network services applications.},

In addition, we model future LMI on-site solar adoption, using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) dGen model. We model future scenarios assuming no changes in the current LMI solar policy and program environment, and we add two incentives to low-income households for adopting solar: a \$\textbackslash\$\$3,000 incentive and a full incentive (i.e., the full cost of a PV system). While we model a financial incentive, this dollar reduction in cost could also come from other efforts, for example, reductions in solar soft costs. We find that by 2050, 48-49\% of LMI households adopt solar, resulting in \$\textbackslash\$\$69- \$\textbackslash\$\$101 billion in first year utility bill savings to these consumers.},

  abstract = {The technical suitability of hydrogen for railway traction is evaluated in the research. World-wide, diesel fuel is currently the main source of energy for railways but relies on petroleum and emits greenhouse gases. Hydrogen as a secondary energy can be produced from fossil fuels or renewables. Thus, a decrease or elimination of emissions is possible, and reliance on petroleum reduced. A well-to-wheel analysis for diesel, electricity, and hydrogen was conducted to establish overall efficiencies and emissions. The results show that hydrogen fuel cell traction has a similar efficiency to electric traction and reduces carbon emissions compared to diesel and in some case electric railways, if the hydrogen feedstock is natural gas. Renewable hydrogen would reduce emissions further. A prototype hydrogen-powered locomotive, the first in the UK, was constructed and employed for a performance evaluation; both demonstrated that hydrogen is suitable for railway traction. Computer modelling of a diesel-electric regional train, a hydrogen-powered vehicle, and a hydrogen-hybrid version was conducted. The journey time and the range of all three options was the same while energy reductions of 34 \% for the hydrogen-only and 55 \% for the hydrogen-hybrid, compared to the diesel were achieved.},

  abstract = {Executive SummaryIt is unequivocal that anthropogenic increases in the well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) have substantially enhanced the greenhouse effect, and the resulting forcing continues to increase. Aerosols partially offset the forcing of the WMGHGs and dominate the uncertainty associated with the total anthropogenic driving of climate change.As in previous IPCC assessments, AR5 uses the radiative forcing (RF) concept, but it also introduces effective radiative forcing (ERF). The RF concept has been used for many years and in previous IPCC assessments for evaluating and comparing the strength of the various mechanisms affecting the Earth's radiation balance and thus causing climate change. Whereas in the RF concept all surface and tropospheric conditions are kept fixed, the ERF calculations presented here allow all physical variables to respond to perturbations except for those concerning the ocean and sea ice. The inclusion of these adjustments makes ERF a better indicator of the eventual temperature response. ERF and RF values are significantly different for anthropogenic aerosols owing to their influence on clouds and on snow cover. These changes to clouds are rapid adjustments and occur on a time scale much faster than responses of the ocean (even the upper layer) to forcing. RF and ERF are estimated over the Industrial Era from 1750 to 2011 if other periods are not explicitly stated.},

Urban-scale analysis at this level of complexity often requires linking multiple emerging tools, rather than using a single tool, to adequately evaluate a variety of possible fields in urban environmental design. To achieve this, flexible platforms are needed to support multiple input formats (e.g., geometric and non-geometric building properties), enabling the mapping of such inputs to underlying simulation engines.},

  abstract = {Natural gas stoves in {$>$}40 million U.S. residences release methane (CH4)─a potent greenhouse gas─through post-meter leaks and incomplete combustion. We quantified methane released in 53 homes during all phases of stove use: steady-state-off (appliance not in use), steady-state-on (during combustion), and transitory periods of ignition and extinguishment. We estimated that natural gas stoves emit 0.8–1.3\% of the gas they use as unburned methane and that total U.S. stove emissions are 28.1 [95\% confidence interval: 18.5, 41.2] Gg CH4 year–1. More than three-quarters of methane emissions we measured originated during steady-state-off. Using a 20-year timeframe for methane, annual methane emissions from all gas stoves in U.S. homes have a climate impact comparable to the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 500\,000 cars. In addition to methane emissions, co-emitted health-damaging air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into home air and can trigger respiratory diseases. In 32 homes, we measured NOx (NO and NO2) emissions and found them to be linearly related to the amount of natural gas burned (r2 = 0.76; p ≪ 0.01). Emissions averaged 21.7 [20.5, 22.9] ng NOx J–1, comprised of 7.8 [7.1, 8.4] ng NO2 J–1 and 14.0 [12.8, 15.1] ng NO J–1. Our data suggest that families who don’t use their range hoods or who have poor ventilation can surpass the 1-h national standard of NO2 (100 ppb) within a few minutes of stove usage, particularly in smaller kitchens.},

  abstract = {Recent emission measurement campaigns have improved our understanding of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the natural gas supply chain, the individual components that contribute to these emissions, and how these emissions vary geographically. However, our current understanding of natural gas supply chain emissions does not account for the linkages between specific production basins and consumers. This work provides a detailed life cycle perspective on how GHG emissions vary according to where natural gas is produced and where it is delivered. This is accomplished by disaggregating transmission and distribution infrastructure into six regions, balancing natural gas supply and demand locations to infer the likely pathways between production and delivery, and incorporating new data on distribution meters. The average transmission distance for U.S. natural gas is 815 km but ranges from 45 to 3000 km across estimated production-to-delivery pairings. In terms of 100-year global warming potentials, the delivery of one megajoule (MJ) of natural gas to the Pacific region has the highest mean life cycle GHG emissions (13.0 g CO2e/MJ) and the delivery of natural gas to the Northeast U.S. has the lowest mean life cycle GHG emissions (8.1 g CO2e/MJ). The cradle-to-delivery scenarios developed in this work show that a national average does not adequately represent the upstream GHG emission intensity for natural gas from a specific basin or delivered to a specific consumer.},

  abstract = {Geothermal technologies can all provide the stable, dispatchable, non-intermittent energy that our energy system needs, yet the challenge of differentiating among these technologies and clearly defining them for the public and decision-makers is impeding progress. Even within the scope of district-scale geothermal technologies, there are multiple naming systems which are not always clearly linked to the specific designs and outcomes. In order to scale the provision of the different types of technologies that tap geothermal energy, technically accurate, clear, and standardized terminology needs to be adopted. This study proposes a taxonomy for geothermal energy networks (GENs), within the context of definitional clarity for geothermal technologies, district energy systems, and thermal energy networks (TENs). We introduce a taxonomy rubric that connects nomenclature and design choices to expected system outcomes. The proposed taxonomy is the product of extensive interviews and stakeholder engagement, with members of the geothermal and ground source heat pump communities, as well as academic, industry, advocacy, workforce, customer, policy and environmental justice groups. Across these industry stakeholders, the link between technology components, system design, performance, and terminology is desired and seen as necessary to industry success. One state regulatory leader referred to TENs as the first new utility in a hundred years. As multiple states and countries create policy to enable geothermal and thermal energy networks at the utility-scale, this proposed taxonomy rubric is intended to provide a clear nomenclature upon which to build statutory language and regulatory frameworks.},

This paper presents an overview of present hydrogen storage technologies, namely, high-pressure gas compression, liquefaction, metal hydride storage, and carbon nanotube adsorption. The energy efficiency, economic aspect, environmental and safety issues of various hydrogen storage technologies were compared. Presently, high-pressure gas compression is favorable due to its high energy efficiency as well as low capital and operation costs. Liquefaction is mainly employed in space applications because of its high volumetric and gravimetric efficiency. The disadvantages are low energy efficiency and high cost. Due to their high volumetric efficiency, metal hydride storage and carbon nanotube adsorption are promising hydrogen storage technologies and are expected to play a key role in hydrogen economy in the future.},

  abstract = {The United States is embarking on an ambitious transition to a 100\% clean energy economy by 2050, which will require improving the flexibility of electric grids. One way to achieve grid flexibility is to shed or shift demand to align with changing grid needs. To facilitate this, it is critical to understand how and when energy is used. High quality end-use load profiles (EULPs) provide this information, and can help cities, states, and utilities understand the time-sensitive value of energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed energy resources. Publicly available EULPs have traditionally had limited application because of age and incomplete geographic representation. To help fill this gap, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock, that culminated in this publicly available dataset of calibrated and validated 15-minute resolution load profiles for all major residential and commercial building types and end uses, across all climate regions in the United States. These EULPs were created by calibrating the ResStock and ComStock physics-based building stock models using many different measured datasets, as described in the "Technical Report Documenting Methodology" linked in the submission.}

Achievable adoption potential for small-scale residential heat pumps is assessed to be around 7.5 TBtu of incremental site energy savings from oil and resistance heating replacements by 2025.},

The Report concludes that, based on a conservative application of constraint assumptions, heat pumps could serve approximately half of the thermal energy load in the small residential sector, with potential to increase this estimate as barriers such as landlord-tenant constraints or availability of hydronic heat pump systems are overcome. Achievable adoption potential for small-scale residential heat pumps is assessed to be around 7.5 TBtu of incremental site energy savings from oil and resistance heating replacements by 2025.},

  abstract = {Given the urgency to decarbonize global energy systems, governments and industry are moving ahead with efforts to increase deployment of hydrogen technologies, infrastructure, and applications at an unprecedented pace, including USD billions in national incentives and direct investments. While zero- and low-carbon hydrogen hold great promise to help solve some of the world's most pressing energy challenges, hydrogen is also an indirect greenhouse gas whose warming impact is both widely overlooked and underestimated. This is largely because hydrogen's atmospheric warming effects are short-lived – lasting only a couple decades – but standard methods for characterizing climate impacts of gases consider only the long-term effect from a one-time pulse of emissions. For gases whose impacts are short-lived, like hydrogen, this long-term framing masks a much stronger warming potency in the near to medium term. This is of concern because hydrogen is a small molecule known to easily leak into the atmosphere, and the total amount of emissions (e.g., leakage, venting, and purging) from existing hydrogen systems is unknown. Therefore, the effectiveness of hydrogen as a decarbonization strategy, especially over timescales of several decades, remains unclear. This paper evaluates the climate consequences of hydrogen emissions over all timescales by employing already published data to assess its potency as a climate forcer, evaluate the net warming impacts from replacing fossil fuel technologies with their clean hydrogen alternatives, and estimate temperature responses to projected levels of hydrogen demand. We use the standard global warming potential metric, given its acceptance to stakeholders, and incorporate newly published equations that more fully capture hydrogen's several indirect effects, but we consider the effects of constant rather than pulse emissions over multiple time horizons. We account for a plausible range of hydrogen emission rates and include methane emissions when hydrogen is produced via natural gas with carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) (“blue” hydrogen) as opposed to renewables and water (“green” hydrogen). For the first time, we show the strong timescale dependence when evaluating the climate change mitigation potential of clean hydrogen alternatives, with the emission rate determining the scale of climate benefits or disbenefits. For example, green hydrogen applications with higher-end emission rates (10 \%) may only cut climate impacts from fossil fuel technologies in half over the first 2 decades, which is far from the common perception that green hydrogen energy systems are climate neutral. However, over a 100-year period, climate impacts could be reduced by around 80 \%. On the other hand, lower-end emissions (1 \%) could yield limited impacts on the climate over all timescales. For blue hydrogen, associated methane emissions can make hydrogen applications worse for the climate than fossil fuel technologies for several decades if emissions are high for both gases; however, blue hydrogen yields climate benefits over a 100-year period. While more work is needed to evaluate the warming impact of hydrogen emissions for specific end-use cases and value-chain pathways, it is clear that hydrogen emissions matter for the climate and warrant further attention from scientists, industry, and governments. This is critical to informing where and how to deploy hydrogen effectively in the emerging decarbonized global economy.},

  abstract = {Accurate and comprehensive quantification of oil and gas methane emissions is pivotal in informing effective methane mitigation policies, while also supporting the assessment and tracking of progress towards emissions reduction targets set by governments and industry. While national bottom-up source-level inventories are useful for understanding the sources of methane emissions, they are often unrepresentative across spatial scales, and their reliance on generic emission factors produces underestimations when compared with measurement-based inventories. Here, we compile and analyze previously reported ground-based facility-level methane emissions measurements in the major US oil and gas producing basins and develop representative methane emission profiles for key facility categories in the US oil and gas supply chain, including well sites, natural gas compressor stations, processing plants, crude oil refineries, and pipelines. We then integrate these emissions data with comprehensive spatial data on national oil and gas activity to estimate each facility’s mean total methane emissions and uncertainties, from which we develop a mean estimate of national methane emissions, resolved at 0.1° × 0.1° spatial scales (\textasciitilde 10 km × 10 km). From this measurement-based methane emissions inventory (EI-ME), we estimate total US national oil/gas methane emissions of 15.7 Tg (95 \% confidence interval of 14–18 Tg) in 2021 which is 2.5 times greater than the EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Our estimate represents a mean gas production-normalized methane loss rate of 2.6 \%, consistent with recent satellite-based estimates. We find significant variability in both the magnitude and spatial distribution of basin-level methane emissions, ranging from {$<$}1 \% methane loss rates in the gas-dominant Appalachian and Haynesville regions to {$>$}3–6 \% in oil-dominant basins, including the Permian, Bakken, and the Uinta. Additionally, we present and compare novel comprehensive wide-area airborne remote sensing data and results of total area methane emissions and the relative contributions of diffuse and concentrated methane point sources as quantified using MethaneAIR in sub-regions of the Permian and Uinta basins that together indicate diffuse area sources accounting for the majority of total regional oil and gas emissions. Our assessment offers key insights into plausible underlying drivers of basin-to-basin variabilities in oil and gas methane emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating measurement-based data in developing high-resolution, spatially explicit methane inventories in support of accurate methane assessment, attribution, and mitigation. The high-resolution spatially explicit EI-ME inventory is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10734300 (Omara et al. 2024).},

One way to achieve grid flexibility is to shed or shift demand to align with changing grid needs. To facilitate this, it is critical to understand how and when energy is used. High quality end-use load profiles (EULPs) provide this information, and can help cities, states, and utilities understand the time-sensitive value of energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed energy resources. Publicly available EULPs have traditionally had limited application because of age and incomplete geographic representation. To help fill this gap, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock, that culminated in this publicly available dataset of calibrated and validated 15-minute resolution load profiles for all major residential and commercial building types and end uses, across all climate regions in the United States.

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) prices have fallen significantly over the past two decades. These price reductions have relied primarily on falling system hardware costs. Future reductions in PV prices—which are needed to ensure that enough PV will be deployed to meet global clean energy objectives—will require reductions in non-hardware or “soft” costs, particularly in markets with relatively high soft costs such as the United States. In this article, we draw insights from the literature on which factors affect soft costs for small-scale PV systems in the United States. The literature shows that soft costs tend to be lower for systems that are larger, installed during new construction, installed by more experienced installers, installed in more concentrated markets and in more competitive markets, installed in markets where customers receive more quotes, or installed in markets with less onerous permitting requirements. We identify three marketplace design strategies that policymakers could pursue to address the soft cost challenge in the United States and similar markets: encourage the expansion of quote platforms; encourage or require that PV system installation be integrated into the new construction and roof replacement process; and encourage the expansion of customer aggregation models such as Solarize campaigns and community solar.},

  abstract = {Building electrification with heat pumps (HPs) is an important pillar of decarbonization. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 provides unprecedented cash incentives to households. However, little is understood of peoples’ preferences or constraints, and hence of the efficacy of these incentives. We develop a residential heating appliance choice model that identifies socio-demographic, contextual and economic determinants of adoption using structural estimation methods with data from the American Housing Survey (AHS). We find that households in warmer, urban areas, with younger heads of household, in larger homes, and with better insulation are more likely to adopt HPs. Using New York state as a case, we predict willingness to pay (WTP) for and adopt HPs under the IRA incentives. We estimate that half of New York households would be willing to adopt HPs by 2030, setting aside other market barriers that could prevent actual adoption. The total subsides would amount to almost four times the IRA’s initial allocation of 9 billion for home improvement for the entire US. The subsidy cost of replacing 70 percent of the heating appliance stock by 2030 could be a third higher. However, this cost could be reduced by 15 percent if subsidies were weighted more towards higher income households, implying a modest trade-off between equity and cost efficiency. These findings underscore the importance of better understanding the heterogeneous home and household conditions that influence HP adoption. Funding for building electrification would have to be increased substantially to achieve high adoption rates.},

  abstract = {Recent exploratory wells in Mali (Bourabougou field) targeting natural hydrogen were a success and provide a new understanding of a first test well exploited by PETROMA (Bougou-1), and a comprehension of continental hydrogen functioning systems. Based on extensive gas data of a pioneer well and preliminary geochemical data obtained from a dozen exploratory wells in the vicinity, it is possible to confirm the presence of an extensive hydrogen field featuring at least five stacked reservoir intervals containing significant hydrogen that cover an estimated area well superior to 8~km in diameter. Results underline the potential economic interest of future natural hydrogen exploitation in continental onshore areas. A “hydrogen system” is presented with a kitchen of generation in the cratonic basement. The relatively pure hydrogen reservoirs are associated with traces of methane, nitrogen and helium. The geological stratigraphic accumulation of hydrogen is linked to the presence of multi overlaid doleritic sills and aquifers that seem to play a role to disable upward gas migration and leakage. The occurrence of a mixture of gas and water acting with an artesian activity confirms the presence of over-pressured fluids. This results in a geyser-type eruptive diphasic surface fluid in many of the wells. The “gas lift” system and the presence of traces of highly unstable carbon monoxide is linked to a recent hydrogen gas charge to reservoirs from underground aquifers, erupting with associated water. The Mali wells underscore the non-fossil source of hydrogen gas and presents features of a sustainable energy. The current estimate of its exploitation price is much cheaper than manufactured hydrogen, either from fossil fuels or from electrolysis.},

  abstract = {Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure, increasing the risk of blackouts or requiring grid reinforcement that can be slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to five times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles could require up to 544 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of \textbackslash\$320 to \textbackslash\$720 billion, or \textbackslash\$2,600 to \textbackslash\$5,800 per household (95\% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management can mitigate demand peaks, reducing grid reinforcement costs by up to 77\%.},

  abstract = {Heating electrification powered by distributed renewable energy generation is considered among potential solutions towards mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Roadmaps propose a wide deployment of heat pumps and photovoltaics in the residential sector. Since current distribution grids are not designed to accommodate these loads, potential benefits of such policies might be compromised. However, in large-scale analyses, often grid constraints are neglected. On the other hand, grid impact of heat pumps and photovoltaics has been investigated without considering the influence of building characteristics. This paper aims to assess and quantify in a probabilistic way the impact of these technologies on the low-voltage distribution grid, as a function of building and district properties. The Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate an assortment of Belgian residential feeders, with varying size, cable type, heat pump and PV penetration rates, and buildings of different geometry and insulation quality. Modelica-based models simulate the dynamic behavior of both buildings and heating systems, as well as three-phase unbalanced loading of the network. Additionally, stochastic occupant behavior is taken into account. Analysis of neighborhood load profiles puts into perspective the importance of demand diversity in terms of building characteristics and load simultaneity, highlighting the crucial role of back-up electrical loads. It is shown that air-source heat pumps have a greater impact on the studied feeders than PV, in terms of loading and voltage magnitude. Furthermore, rural feeders are more prone to overloading and under-voltage problems than urban ones. For large rural feeders, cable overloading can be expected already from 30\% heat pump penetration, depending on the cable, while voltage problems start usually at slightly higher percentages. Additionally, building characteristics show high correlations with the examined grid performance indicators, revealing promising potential for statistical modeling of the studied indicators. Further work will be directed to the assessment of meta-modeling techniques for this purpose. The presented models and methodology can easily incorporate other technologies or scenarios and could be used in support of policy making or network design.},

This study found that LDES could cost effectively support bulk grid decarbonization and environmental justice; however, the more stringent resilience requirements of a customer microgrid potentially make LDES-based microgrids less cost-effective.}

  abstract = {With increasing global interest in molecular hydrogen to replace fossil fuels, more attention is being paid to potential leakages of hydrogen into the atmosphere and its environmental consequences. Hydrogen is not directly a greenhouse gas, but its chemical reactions change the abundances of the greenhouse gases methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapor, as well as aerosols. Here, we use a model ensemble of five global atmospheric chemistry models to estimate the 100-year time-horizon Global Warming Potential (GWP100) of hydrogen. We estimate a hydrogen GWP100 of 11.6\,±\,2.8 (one standard deviation). The uncertainty range covers soil uptake, photochemical production of hydrogen, the lifetimes of hydrogen and methane, and the hydroxyl radical feedback on methane and hydrogen. The hydrogen-induced changes are robust across the different models. It will be important to keep hydrogen leakages at a minimum to accomplish the benefits of switching to a hydrogen economy.},

  abstract = {Shallow geothermal is a renewable green energy that can provide heating and cooling for buildings in a safe, non-emitting, and affordable way, thus reducing the dependence on natural gas. The ground source heat pump (GSHP), also known as a geothermal heat pump, is the most efficient technology to utilize shallow geothermal by transferring heat between the shallow ground and buildings. It primarily consists of borehole heat exchangers with a U-pipe installed inside a borehole where water is continuously circulated in a closed (supply-return) loop using a heat pump. A thermal response test (TRT) is performed to assess the performance of a borehole heat exchanger. A constant input heat (Q) is applied to the circulating water, and its temperature on the supply and return side of the closed loop is continuously measured. Conventional instrumentation (i.e., the thermocouples installed at the end of the supply and return pipes) and methods for analyzing TRT results (e.g., using the line source method) evaluate only the average thermal properties without considering any variations along the depth. Using distributed fiber optic sensors (DFOS) in TRT can provide continuous temperature measurement throughout the depth with a good spatial resolution. The temperature profile data can provide a complete understanding of the thermal mechanism, eventually leading to a better and more efficient design. This paper describes a field-scale installation, testing, and sensing of three 600-feet geothermal boreholes. DFOS were installed inside and outside the U-pipe to measure the circulating water and the nearby soil temperature. A Brillouin-based interrogator was used to monitor the temperature changes during TRT with an accuracy of 1°C and a spatial resolution of 1 m. The temperature profile data were analyzed to understand the thermal response and estimate the variation of thermal properties with depth. The study also shows that DFOS can be effectively deployed in a borehole heat exchanger to provide real-time and long-term monitoring capabilities resulting in a better-informed and more efficient design.},

  abstract = {The costs of maintaining California’s natural gas distribution system are steadily growing, despite the state’s climate plans showing a clear need to dramatically reduce gas combustion to meet state climate targets. To support safety and reliability, gas utilities replace hundreds of miles of gas pipeline every year. Based on near-term plans and recent trends, California’s gas utilities are on track to replace 8,900 miles of gas distribution mains by 2045 at a projected total cost of \$43 billion. A geographically-targeted building electrification program could fully electrify blocks or neighborhoods to avoid some gas pipeline replacement projects. At scale across California, we estimate that targeted building electrification and gas decommissioning projects, implemented where feasible, could avoid \$20 billion in gas pipeline replacement costs by 2045 while only affecting 3\% of current gas customers. In 2024, these savings would average approximately \$32,000 per affected customer, which we expect would be enough to cover the upfront costs of electrification. However, these cost savings will be challenging to achieve if 100\% opt-in is required from affected customers, as a single customer hold-out could prevent a project from going forward and capturing these cost savings. Achieving gas system cost savings at this scale would benefit from legislative or regulatory clarification that utilities may pursue these projects without requiring 100\% opt-in from affected customers.},

  abstract = {Recent investments in “clean” hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels are driven by anticipated climate benefits. However, most climate benefit calculations do not adequately account for all climate warming emissions and impacts over time. This study reanalyzes a previously published life cycle assessment as an illustrative example to show how the climate impacts of hydrogen deployment can be far greater than expected when including the warming effects of hydrogen emissions, observed methane emission intensities, and near-term time scales; this reduces the perceived climate benefits upon replacement of fossil fuel technologies. For example, for blue (natural gas with carbon capture) hydrogen pathways, the inclusion of upper-end hydrogen and methane emissions can yield an increase in warming in the near term by up to 50\%, whereas lower-end emissions decrease warming impacts by at least 70\%. For green (renewable-based electrolysis) hydrogen pathways, upper-end hydrogen emissions can reduce climate benefits in the near term by up to 25\%. We also consider renewable electricity availability for green hydrogen and show that if it is not additional to what is needed to decarbonize the electric grid, there may be more warming than that seen with fossil fuel alternatives over all time scales. Assessments of hydrogen’s climate impacts should include the aforementioned factors if hydrogen is to be an effective decarbonization tool.},

  abstract = {To meet ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction in the 2035-2050 timeframe, hydrogen has been identified as a clean “green” fuel of interest. In comparison to fossil fuel use the burning of hydrogen results in zero CO2 emissions and it can be obtained from renewable energy sources. In addition to zero CO2 emissions, hydrogen has several other attractive properties such as higher gravimetric energy content and wider flammability limits than most fossil fuels. However, there are practical limitations to its widespread use at present which include low volumetric energy density in the gaseous state and high well-to-wheel costs when compared to fossil fuel production and distribution. In this paper a review is undertaken to identify the current state of development of key areas of the hydrogen network such as production, distribution, storage and power conversion technology. At present high technology costs still are a barrier to widespread hydrogen adoption but it is envisioned that as scale of production increases, then costs are likely to fall. Technical barriers to a hydrogen economy adoption are not as significant as one might think as key technologies in the hydrogen network are already mature with working prototypes already developed for technologies such as liquid hydrogen composite cryotanks and proton exchange membrane fuel cells. It is envisioned that with continuous investment to achieve requisite scale that a hydrogen economy could be realised sooner rather than later with novel concepts such as turboelectric distributed propulsion enabled by a shift to hydrogen-powered network.},

  author = {Turk, Graham},
  abstract = {Decarbonizing the transportation and residential building sectors will require rapid electrification through the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) and cold climate heat pumps (CCHPs), respectively. There is broad consensus that the flat volumetric electricity tariffs currently in place for residential customers in most of the US discourage electrification and do not reflect the underlying marginal costs of electricity delivery. Under flat volumetric tariffs, utilities are projecting sharp rises in distribution-level peak demand, which will necessitate network upgrades whose costs are recovered from all grid users. Alternative rate designs can help mitigate the need for these upgrades by shifting new demand away from peak periods. However, there is an emerging narrative that electricity tariff design is a zero-sum game: regulators can either protect vulnerable households or encourage electrification, but not both. In this thesis, we challenge that perception by asking whether well-designed distribution network tariffs can deliver a win-win in the long run, reducing operating costs for EVs and/or CCHPs and average network costs for households that cannot yet afford to electrify. We answer this question by running a series of bottom-up optimizations to simulate household’s responses to alternative network tariff designs in two distinct geographies, then assessing cost impacts on different household groups. We use open-source data on household electricity consumption and travel behavior. We find that beyond very low adoption levels, time-of-use per-kWh network tariffs, which several states have adopted as the default, perform poorly on all metrics and lead to large increases in local peak demand. Per-kW capacity tariffs (subscription and demand charges) are effective at mitigating EV-driven peaks, especially when paired with TOU energy tariffs. We recommend that regulators separate network charges from energy charges and introduce a per-kW subscription network tariff to collect a portion of the network revenue requirement. This approach will reduce the total cost of ownership of electrified devices while mitigating the network upgrades needed to maintain reliability. Our recommendations offer a path towards rapid electrification that benefits all grid users.},

However, e-fuels’ versatility is counterbalanced by their fragile climate effectiveness, high costs and uncertain availability. E-fuel mitigation costs are €800–1,200 per tCO2. Large-scale deployment could reduce costs to €20–270 per tCO2 until 2050, yet it is unlikely that e-fuels will become cheap and abundant early enough. Neglecting demand-side transformations threatens to lock in a fossil-fuel dependency if e-fuels fall short of expectations. Sensible climate policy supports e-fuel deployment while hedging against the risk of their unavailability at large scale. Policies should be guided by a ‘merit order of end uses’ that prioritizes hydrogen and e-fuels for sectors that are inaccessible to direct electrification.},

  abstract = {We estimate methane emissions from U.S. local distribution natural gas (NG) pipes using data collected from an advanced mobile leak detection (AMLD) platform. We estimate that there are 630,000 leaks in U.S. distribution mains, resulting in methane emissions of 0.69 Tg/year (95\% cr int: 0.25, 1.23). Total emissions are calculated as the product of activity factors and emissions factors. Our analysis leveraged data on {$>$}4000 leak indications found using AMLD, combined with utility pipeline GIS information, to allow us to estimate activity factors. We derive emissions factors from AMLD emission rate estimates and correct these emissions factors based on data from in-field studies assessing AMLD emissions estimates. Finally, we quantify uncertainty in both emissions factors and activity factors and propagate the uncertainty to our total emissions estimate. In modeling leak frequency, we find a clear interaction between pipeline material and age with the leakiness of all material types increasing with age. Our national methane emissions estimate is approximately 5× greater (95\% cr int: 1.7×, 8.7×) than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s current greenhouse gas inventory estimate for pipeline mains in local distribution systems due to both a larger estimated number of leaks and better characterization of the upper tail of the skewed distribution of emission rates.},

Raw scores above the mean have positive standard scores, while those below the mean have negative standard scores.  It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation. This process of converting a raw score into a standard score is called standardizing or normalizing (however, "normalizing" can refer to many types of ratios; see Normalization for more).  Standard scores are most commonly called z-scores; the two terms may be used interchangeably, as they are in this article. Other equivalent terms in use include z-value, z-statistic, normal score, standardized variable and pull in high energy physics.  Computing a z-score requires knowledge of the mean and standard deviation of the complete population to which a data point belongs; if one only has a sample of observations from the population, then the analogous computation using the sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the t-statistic.},

We use physics simulations of 550,000 statistically representative households to analyze distributions of the costs and benefits of three air-to-air heat pump performance levels, with and without insulation upgrades, across the diversity of the US housing stock. We find positive greenhouse gas reductions in every US state for all performance levels across five 2022–2038 electric grid scenarios, with full adoption reducing national emissions by 5\%–9\%. We find that air-to-air heat pumps could be cost effective without subsidies in 59\% of households (65 million). However, efficiency is key: whereas minimum-efficiency equipment could increase energy bills in 39\% of households, this fraction is only 19\% when also upgrading insulation or 5\% when using higher-efficiency equipment, though both strategies have higher upfront costs. Such affordability challenges could be addressed through supportive incentives, policy, and innovation.},
