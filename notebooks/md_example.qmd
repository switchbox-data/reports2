# Quarto Markdown Capabilities

This document demonstrates the markdown formatting capabilities of Quarto **without any executable code**. It serves as a reference for basic text formatting, mathematical expressions, and document structure.

## Introduction

This example focuses purely on Quarto's markdown rendering features. For executable code examples, you can create additional `.qmd` files with Python, R, or other language code blocks.

## Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also create `inline code` formatting.

### Lists

Unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered list:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Mathematical Expressions

You can include mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Display math:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data A   | Value 1  |
| Row 2    | Data B   | Value 2  |
| Row 3    | Data C   | Value 3  |

## Conclusion

This document showcases Quarto's markdown formatting capabilities without any code execution. To create notebooks with executable code:

1. Create new `.qmd` files in this directory
2. Add Python, R, or other language code blocks using fenced code blocks with language specifiers
3. Use `quarto render` or `quarto preview` to execute and display results

This serves as a foundation for building more complex computational documents.
